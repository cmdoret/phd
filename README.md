# PhD Thesis
**cmdoret, 2020**

This repository contains all the different latex files required to compile my PhD thesis.
This is based on the cleanthesis style, hosted at: https://github.com/derric/cleanthesis

To compile the thesis into a pdf file, simply run `make`. The precompiled pdf is available in releases.
