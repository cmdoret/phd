\section{Reproducibility and reliability challenges}
% Impact of the reproducibility crisis
Results from genomics analyses are especially sensitive to the parameters and methods used. This makes reproducibility in bioinformatics of utmost importance. Just like RNAseq, Hi-C has important technical variability which needs to be accounted for using multiple replicates.
