As 3C protocols improve and the cost of sequencing decreases, it will be possible to probe finer details of spatial regulation during bacterial infection. While current projects are mostly limited to analyzing major changes, higher sequencing depth and increasing numbers of replicates should allow for more contrast and with it, the detection of more subtle changes in spatial interactions.

% Single cell (spatial heterogeneity)
Another exciting point is the advent of single-cell omics methods. This is especially interesting for infection genomics, where bulk Hi-C signal contains a mixture of cells at different infection stage and cell cycle phase. These single-cell methodologies may allow to further refine the analysis and deconvolute different effects obscuring the signal of interest.

This work is still among the first of its kind and we expect to see major developments in the use of 3D genomics to understand dysregulation in infection. There is still much to be learnt in the interplay of the various layers of regulation, and spatial organization will likely become an integrative part of many projects aiming to understand it.
