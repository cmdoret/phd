Organisms in all branches of the tree of life establish stable interactions with different species. These are often classified according to their perceived impact on the fitness of their members. We traditionally talk about parasitism for interactions with one-way benefits, and mutualism when the interaction has a positive impact on all parties involved.

Biological interactions are observed at different scales, from nanometer-scale virophages infecting giant viruses to fungi forming mycorrhyzal networks spanning up to several kilometers allowing exchange of nutrients with plants root systems. These interactions shape the evolutionary trajectories of the species involved and their genomic landscapes. These genomic changes can sometimes result in drastic transitions in the organisms' lifestyle. This can be the case for example with intracellular bacteria forming symbiosis with their host cells, known as endosymbionts. Wolbachia is a famous example of endosymbiotic bacteria infecting arthropod species. This bacterium is a reproductive parasite illustrating the sometimes blurry line between parasitism and mutualism. It alters the reproductive capabilities of its host, causing some sexual species to reproduce asexually by parthenogenesis for its own benefit. In some species infection by Wolbachia has even become necessary for reproduction. While the bacterium takes advantage of its host reproduction, it also provides numerous advantages such as resistance to viruses in mosquito species and help with vitamin synthesis in flies.

\section{The evolutionary context of host parasite interactions}

An analogy often used to describe the evolutionary dynamics of host-parasite interactions is an arms race, where each organism evolves novel strategies to improve its own fitness at the expense of the other. This is the case for intracellular bacteria such as Legionella, which can secrete a large arsenal of effector proteins into their host's cytoplasm. Many of these proteins are redundant in the sense that they interact with the same host proteins or pathways. This redundancy is likely an important strategy for parasites with several hosts or changing environments, as some of those redundant effectors could be functional in different hosts or particular environmental conditions.

As intracellular parasites become reliant on their host for most metabolic pathways, they undergo a process known as genome reduction: Pathways provided by the host need no longer be encoded by the parasite and are therefore lost. This process eventually leads to the parasite becoming completely reliant on its host. The progressive accumulation of mutation (and loss) in their genome is known as Muller's ratchet. The only way for intracellular parasites to escape this ineluctable degradation is to acquire genetic material, either from their host or from other microorganisms sharing the same host cytoplasm.

Such genetic transfers are known as horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and are a major contributor to bacterial genomes, with an estimated 80\% of genes being the product of HGT. More recently, HGT have also been detected in eukaryotes. Although they are much less frequent (about 1\% of genes), gene transfers from intracellular microorganisms to eukaryotic hosts are thought to have been involved in major shifts in environmental niche. Examples are the terrestrial colonization of plants and extremophile eukaryotes such as sea ice diatoms which acquired ice binding proteins from prokaryotes.

\section{Amoeba as a host model}

\section{\textit{Legionella pneumophila}}

\textit{L. pneumophila} infects amoeba in the wild but can also infect humans.

\section{\textit{Salmonella enterica}}

Unlike {L. pneumophila}, {S. enterica} only infects birds and mammals. It is a major human pathogen.
