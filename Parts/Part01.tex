\ctparttext{In this introductory part, we delve into the biology of infection and describe the complex relationships between pathogens and their hosts. We also discuss the evolutionary implications of these associations. We then focus on two model systems for infection biology: \textit{Salmonella enterica} and \textit{Legionella pneumophila}. We then provide an overview of how recent advances in genomics have pushed the knowledge of these systems and their current limitaitons.} % Describe here content of the first part
