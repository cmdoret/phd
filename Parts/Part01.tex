\ctparttext{
In this first part, we introduce the complex relationships between hosts and their parasites. 
We also discuss the evolutionary implications of these associations. We then focus on two 
model systems for infection biology: \textit{Salmonella enterica} and \textit{Legionella pneumophila}. 
We then provide an overview of how recent advances in genomics have pushed the knowledge of 
these systems and their current limitations.
