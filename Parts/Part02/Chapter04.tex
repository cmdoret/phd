\chapter{Viral insertions in the human genome} % Chapter title

Viruses represent another type of host pathogen interactions. Some of those viruses, including the hepatitis B virus (HBV), have the ability to insert their genetic material into the genome of their host. Depending on the genomic landscape around those insertions, it can have various effects on the host cells.

It is known that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a type of liver cancer, are frequently associated with HBV insertions.

Here we investigate the location of those viral insertions in multiple HCC cell lines, the epigenetic marks present at those regions and how they affect the local 3D structure.
