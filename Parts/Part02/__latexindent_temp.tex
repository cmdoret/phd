%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Legionella pneumophila alters its host signal transduction, metabolism and gene regulation upon infection. In addition to all these changes, it also affects host histone marks, which are known to be related to gene regulation and genome architecture. In this chapter, we investigate the genome structure of \textit{A. castellanii} and how it is affected during infection by
