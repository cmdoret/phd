In this chapter, we investigate whether, and how \textit{Salmonella} infection can affect the chromatin regulation of its eukaryotic host. Much like \textit{Legionella}, \textit{Salmonella} manipulates its host cell's defense and signalling to promote its own survival in their cytoplasm. Using a mouse \acrfull{BMM} model, we measure changes in chromatin architecture, accessibility and gene expression in different infection conditions and timepoint to explore the potential epigenetic deregulations happening during this process.
