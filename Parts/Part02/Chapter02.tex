\textit{Legionella pneumophila} alters its host signal transduction, metabolism and gene regulation upon infection \cite{escollTargetingHostOrganelles2016,escollLegionellaPneumophilaModulates2017}. In addition to all these changes, it also affects host histone marks \cite{rolandoLegionellaPneumophilaEffector2013}, which are known to be related to gene regulation and genome architecture \cite{bonevOrganizationFunction3D2016}. In this chapter, we investigate the genome structure of the amoeba \textit{A. castellanii}, a natural host of \textit{L. pneumophila}, and how it is affected during infection by the bacterium.

Several strains of \textit{A. castellanii} have been isolated throughout history. These strains may originate from different ecological niches of geographical locations and have been cultivated in laboratories for long preriods. As a result, they can differ in various phenotypes, including susceptibility to infection. Comparing such divergent strains can also help us understand what genomic features are important for pathogen susceptibility.

As with most other genomics techniques, a prerequisite of Hi-C analyses is to have a high quality reference genome with clearly delimited chromosomes. At the time of writing, the \textit{A. castellanii} reference genome is split into 3192 contigs merged into 384 scaffolds which do not represent chromosomes.

This prompted us to generate a chromosome-level genome assembly for two strains of \textit{A. castellanii}: The Neff strain \cite{neffPurificationAxenicCultivation1957}, which is the most widely used strain for genomic analyses in that species, and the C3 strain \cite{michelIsolationAcanthamoebaStrain1997}, which is generally used for infection experiments with \textit{L. pneumophila} due to higher intracellular bacterial replication. In the following manuscript, we describe and compare the genomic landscape of both strains, as well as the spatial organization of their genomes. We also investigate changes happening in the 3D genome organization in response to infection by \textit{L. pneumophila}.

\section{Inter-strain sequence divergence}

To put into perspective the divergence between \textit{A. castellanii} strains Neff and C3, here we compare them to 11 other amoeba species whose genomes are available. As described in the previous section, we extracted all predicted coding sequences from each species and used orthofinder (v2.3.3) to constitute groups of orthologous genes among these proteomes.

We constructed a phylogenetic tree using orthofinder's built-in implementation of the STAG (Species Tree inference from All Genes) procedure \cite{emmsSTAGSpeciesTree2018}. Briefly, Orthofinder builds a tree for each gene based on multiple sequence alignment, and then uses all gene trees where all species are available to build a species tree. The species tree is then rooted by Orthofinder using the STRIDE (Species Tree Root Inference from gene Duplication Events) procedure \cite{emmsSTRIDESpeciesTree2017}. In the resulting tree, C3 and Neff are highly divergent from the closest available relative, \textit{Planoprotostelium fungivorum} (Fig. \ref{fig:02-02:acas-comp}a). Both strains exhibit a high (protein) sequence divergence, with about 0.084 amino-acid substitution per site. This is comparable to inter-species divergence in some groups, for example 0.061 between \textit{Entamoeba histolytica} and \textit{Entamoeba dispar}. It is important to note, however, that branch length and topology may be inaccurate for distantly related groups. This could be due to numerous factors, including low quality of assemblies used to infer proteomes, contaminations and and horizontal gene transfers \cite{kapliPhylogeneticTreeBuilding2020}. When computing the DNA sequence divergence across aligned genomic segments between the two strains, we observe an average of 6.65\% nucleotide substitions (Fig. \ref{fig:02-02:acas-div}). In comparison, computing this same metric between Neff and \textit{Dictyostelium discoideum} yields 11.8\% substitutions, however this could be an underestimate, since focusing on aligned segments will likely select for regions with high conservation.

As mentioned earlier, over 10\% of \textit{A. castellanii} orthogroups are strain-specific (Fig. \ref{fig:02-02:acas-comp}b), further emphasizing their strong differences. There also seems the be a few major genomic rearrangements between the two strains, however it is hard to assess whether these are genuine inter-strain differences. These segments could also be the product of mis-assemblies induced by the collapse of heterozygous structural variants in either strains.
