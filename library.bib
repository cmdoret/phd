  abstract = {Most existing coverage-based (epi)genomic datasets are one-dimensional, but newer technologies probing interactions (physical, genetic, etc.) produce quantitative maps with two-dimensional genomic coordinate systems. Storage and computational costs mount sharply with data resolution when such maps are stored in dense form. Hence, there is a pressing need to develop data storage strategies that handle the full range of useful resolutions in multidimensional genomic datasets by taking advantage of their sparse nature, while supporting efficient compression and providing fast random access to facilitate development of scalable algorithms for data analysis. We developed a file format called cooler, based on a sparse data model, that can support genomically labeled matrices at any resolution. It has the flexibility to accommodate various descriptions of the data axes (genomic coordinates, tracks and bin annotations), resolutions, data density patterns and metadata. Cooler is based on HDF5 and is supported by a Python library and command line suite to create, read, inspect and manipulate cooler data collections. The format has been adopted as a standard by the NIH 4D Nucleome Consortium.Cooler is cross-platform, BSD-licensed and can be installed from the Python package index or the bioconda repository. The source code is maintained on Github at https://github.com/mirnylab/cooler.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {The growth rate of Salmonella typhimurium U937 within host macrophages was estimated by two independent methods. The extent to which ribosomal protein L12 is acetylated to produce ribosomal protein L7 changes markedly with the growth rate. By this measure, the intracellular bacteria appeared to be growing rapidly. Measurements of viable bacteria, however, indicated that the bacteria were growing slowly. A solution of this apparent growth rate paradox was sought by treating U937 cells infected with S. typhimurium X3306 with ampicillin or chloramphenicol to help determine the number of bacteria that were actively growing and dividing in the intracellular condition. Use of these antibiotics showed that by 2 h after invasion, the intracellular bacteria consisted of at least two populations, one static and the other rapidly dividing. This finding implies that previously described changes in the gene expression of S. typhimurium are important for the survival and/or multiplication of the bacteria within the macrophage.},

  abstract = {The immediate-early response mediates cell fate in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli and is dysregulated in many cancers. However, the specificity of the response across stimuli and cell types, and the roles of non-coding RNAs are not well understood. Using a large collection of densely-sampled time series expression data we have examined the induction of the immediate-early response in unparalleled detail, across cell types and stimuli. We exploit cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) time series datasets to directly measure promoter activities over time. Using a novel analysis method for time series data we identify transcripts with expression patterns that closely resemble the dynamics of known immediate-early genes (IEGs) and this enables a comprehensive comparative study of these genes and their chromatin state. Surprisingly, these data suggest that the earliest transcriptional responses often involve promoters generating non-coding RNAs, many of which are produced in advance of canonical protein-coding IEGs. IEGs are known to be capable of induction without de novo protein synthesis. Consistent with this, we find that the response of both protein-coding and non-coding RNA IEGs can be explained by their transcriptionally poised, permissive chromatin state prior to stimulation. We also explore the function of non-coding RNAs in the attenuation of the immediate early response in a small RNA sequencing dataset matched to the CAGE data: We identify a novel set of microRNAs responsible for the attenuation of the IEG response in an estrogen receptor positive cancer cell line. Our computational statistical method is well suited to meta-analyses as there is no requirement for transcripts to pass thresholds for significant differential expression between time points, and it is agnostic to the number of time points per dataset.},

We also elucidate the structure of pairing with unprecedented detail, observing significant variation across the genome and revealing at least two forms of pairing: tight pairing, spanning contiguous small domains, and loose pairing, consisting of single larger domains. Strikingly, active genomic regions (A-type compartments, active chromatin, expressed genes) correlated with tight pairing, suggesting that pairing has a functional implication genome-wide. Finally, using RNAi and haplotype-resolved Hi-C, we show that disruption of pairing-promoting factors results in global changes in pairing, including the disruption of some interaction peaks.},

  abstract = {The mammalian genome is transcribed into large numbers of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), but the definition of functional lncRNA groups has proven difficult, partly due to their low sequence conservation and lack of identified shared properties. Here we consider positional conservation across mammalian genomes as an indicator of functional commonality. We identify 665 conserved lncRNA promoters in mouse and human genomes that are preserved in genomic position relative to orthologous coding genes. The identified `positionally conserved' lncRNA genes are primarily associated with developmental transcription factor loci with which they are co-expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Strikingly, over half of all positionally conserved RNAs in this set are linked to distinct chromatin organization structures, overlapping the binding sites for the CTCF chromatin organizer and located at chromatin loop anchor points and borders of topologically associating domains (TADs). These                            t                          opological                            a                          nchor                            p                          oint (tap)RNAs possess conserved sequence domains that are enriched in potential recognition motifs for Zinc Finger proteins. Characterization of these noncoding RNAs and their associated coding genes shows that they are functionally connected: they regulate each other's expression and influence the metastatic phenotype of cancer cells             in vitro             in a similar fashion. Thus, interrogation of positionally conserved lncRNAs identifies a new subset of tapRNAs with shared functional properties. These results provide a large dataset of lncRNAs that conform to the ``extended gene'' model, in which conserved developmental genes are genomically and functionally linked to regulatory lncRNA loci across mammalian evolution.},

The purpose of this study was to determine which morphological feature provides the best correlation with body size and egg load in a thelytokous population of the parasitoid wasp, Lysiphlebus fabarum (Marshall), when reared on Aphis fabae Scopoli under standardized conditions in a growth chamber (21 {$\pm$} 1\textdegree C, 60\textendash 70\% RH, and 16L : 8D). Candidate metrics included head width, length and width of the pronotum, length and width of the right forewing, and length of the right hind tibia. In the first experiment, correlations were determined between these measurements and overall wasp body length. As head width and hind tibia length emerged as the most suitable proxies for total body length, the next experiment these two variables as proxies for egg load in females reared from different nymphal instars of the host aphid. There was a non-linear relationship between body size and egg load of wasps emerging from hosts parasitized in different nymphal instars. Egg load increased linearly with body size across all host growth stages, but the second nymphal instar was the most suitable stage for parasitism when speed of development was factored in. The results suggest that head width is a suitable morphometric for monitoring quality control in mass-reared cultures of this wasp.},

How SMC complexes translocate along DNA for loop extrusion and what happens when two complexes meet on the same DNA molecule is largely unknown. Revealing the origins and the consequences of SMC encounters is crucial for understanding the folding process not only of bacterial, but also of eukaryotic chromosomes. Here, we uncover several factors that influence bacterial chromosome organization by modulating the probability of such clashes. These factors include the number, the strength, and the distribution of Smc loading sites, the residency time on the chromosome, the translocation rate, and the cellular abundance of Smc complexes. By studying various mutants, we show that these parameters are fine-tuned to reduce the frequency of encounters between Smc complexes, presumably as a risk mitigation strategy. Mild perturbations hamper chromosome organization by causing Smc collisions, implying that the cellular capacity to resolve them is limited. Altogether, we identify mechanisms that help to avoid Smc collisions and their resolution by Smc traversal or other potentially risky molecular transactions.},

During mouse limb development,               Hoxd               genes are transcribed in two waves: early on, when the arm and forearm are specified, and later, when digits form. The transition between early and late regulations involves a functional switch between two opposite topological domains. This switch is reflected by a subset of               Hoxd               genes mapping centrally into the cluster, which initially interact with the telomeric domain and subsequently swing toward the centromeric domain, where they establish new contacts. This transition between independent regulatory landscapes illustrates both the modularity of the limbs and the distinct evolutionary histories of its various pieces. It also allows the formation of an intermediate area of low HOX proteins content, which develops into the wrist, the transition between our arms and our hands. This regulatory strategy accounts for collinear               Hox               gene regulation in land vertebrate appendages.},

  abstract = {Toll-like receptors (TLRs) contribute to host resistance to microbial pathogens and can drive the evolution of virulence mechanisms. We have examined the relationship between host resistance and pathogen virulence using mice with a functional allele of the nramp-1 gene and lacking combinations of TLRs. Mice deficient in both TLR2 and TLR4 were highly susceptible to the intracellular bacterial pathogen Salmonella typhimurium, consistent with reduced innate immune function. However, mice lacking additional TLRs involved in S. typhimurium recognition were less susceptible to infection. In these TLR-deficient cells, bacteria failed to upregulate Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2) genes and did not form a replicative compartment. We demonstrate that TLR signaling enhances the rate of acidification of the Salmonella-containing phagosome, and inhibition of this acidification prevents SPI-2 induction. Our results indicate that S. typhimurium requires cues from the innate immune system to regulate virulence genes necessary for intracellular survival, growth, and systemic infection. PaperFlick},

  abstract = {Epigenetics is the study of changes in gene activity that can be transmitted through cell divisions but cannot be explained by changes in the DNA sequence. Epigenetic mechanisms are central to gene regulation, phenotypic plasticity, development and the preservation of genome integrity. Epigenetic mechanisms are often held to make a minor contribution to evolutionary change because epigenetic states are typically erased and reset at every generation, and are therefore, not heritable. Nonetheless, there is growing appreciation that epigenetic variation makes direct and indirect contributions to evolutionary processes. First, some epigenetic states are transmitted intergenerationally and affect the phenotype of offspring. Moreover, bona fide heritable `epialleles' exist and are quite common in plants. Such epialleles could, therefore, be subject to natural selection in the same way as conventional DNA sequence-based alleles. Second, epigenetic variation enhances phenotypic plasticity and phenotypic variance and thus can modulate the effect of natural selection on sequence-based genetic variation. Third, given that phenotypic plasticity is central to the adaptability of organisms, epigenetic mechanisms that generate plasticity and acclimation are important to consider in evolutionary theory. Fourth, some genes are under selection to be `imprinted' identifying the sex of the parent from which they were derived, leading to parent-of-origin-dependent gene expression and effects. These effects can generate hybrid disfunction and contribute to speciation. Finally, epigenetic processes, particularly DNA methylation, contribute directly to DNA sequence evolution, because they act as mutagens on the one hand and modulate genome stability on the other by keeping transposable elements in check.This article is part of the theme issue `How does epigenetics influence the course of evolution?'},

We show here that LPS regulated several members of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) family at the mRNA level in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM). LPS transiently repressed, then induced a number of HDACs (Hdac-4, 5, 7) in BMM, whereas Hdac-1 mRNA was induced more rapidly. Treatment of BMM with trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of HDACs, enhanced LPS-induced expression of the Cox-2, Cxcl2, and Ifit2 genes. In the case of Cox-2, this effect was also apparent at the promoter level. Overexpression of Hdac-8 in RAW264 murine macrophages blocked the ability of LPS to induce Cox-2 mRNA. Another class of LPS-inducible genes, which included Ccl2, Ccl7, and Edn1, was suppressed by TSA, an effect most likely mediated by PU.1 degradation. Hence, HDACs act as potent and selective negative regulators of proinflammatory gene expression and act to prevent excessive inflammatory responses in macrophages.\textemdash Aung, H.

  abstract = {Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a facultative intracellular human and animal bacterial pathogen posing a major threat to public health worldwide. Salmonella pathogenicity requires complex coordination of multiple physiological and virulence pathways. DksA is a conserved Gram-negative regulator that belongs to a distinct group of transcription factors that bind directly to the RNA polymerase secondary channel, potentiating the effect of the signaling molecule ppGpp during a stringent response. Here, we established that in S. Typhimurium, dksA is induced during the logarithmic phase and DksA is essential for growth in minimal defined medium and plays an important role in motility and biofilm formation. Furthermore, we determined that DksA positively regulates the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 and motility-chemotaxis genes and is necessary for S. Typhimurium invasion of human epithelial cells and uptake by macrophages. In contrast, DksA was found to be dispensable for S. Typhimurium host cell adhesion. Finally, using the colitis mouse model, we found that dksA is spatially induced at the midcecum during the early stage of the infection and required for gastrointestinal colonization and systemic infection in vivo. Taken together, these data indicate that the ancestral stringent response regulator DksA coordinates various physiological and virulence S. Typhimurium programs and therefore is a key virulence regulator of Salmonella.},

We defined a set of 54 944 human lincRNAs by drawing on four publicly available lincRNA datasets, and annotated \$2.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from each of 15 cardiometabolic genome-wide association study datasets into these lincRNAs. We identified hundreds of lincRNAs with at least one trait-associated SNP: 898 SNPs in 343 unique lincRNAs at 5\% false discovery rate, and 469 SNPs in 146 unique lincRNAs meeting Bonferroni-corrected P {$<$} 0.05. An additional 64 trait-associated lincRNAs were identified using a class-level testing strategy at Bonferroni-corrected P {$<$} 0.05. To better understand the genomic context and prioritize trait-associated lincRNAs, we examined the pattern of linkage disequilibrium between SNPs in the lincRNAs and SNPs that met genome-wide-significance in the region (6500 kb of lincRNAs). A subset of the lincRNA-trait association findings was replicated in independent Genome-wide association studies data from the Pakistan Risk of Myocardial Infarction Study study. For trait-associated lincRNAs, we also investigated synteny and conservation relative to mouse, expression patterns in five cardiometabolic-relevant tissues, and allele-specific expression in RNA sequencing data for adipose tissue and leukocytes. Finally, we revealed a functional role in human adipocytes for linc-NFE2L3-1, which is expressed in adipose and is associated with waist-hip ratio adjusted for BMI. This comprehensive profile of trait-associated lincRNAs provides novel insights into disease mechanism and serves as a launching point for interrogation of the biology of specific lincRNAs in cardiometabolic disease.},

Loops were hypothesized to form by `loop extrusion,' by which structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complexes, such as condensin and cohesin, bind to chromatin, reel it in, and extrude it as a loop. However, such exotic motor activity had never been observed. Following an explosion of indirect evidence, recent single-molecule experiments directly imaged DNA loop extrusion by condensin and cohesin in vitro. These experiments observe rapid (kb/s) extrusion that requires ATP hydrolysis and stalls under pN forces. Surprisingly, condensin extrudes loops asymmetrically, challenging previous models. Extrusion by cohesin is symmetric~but requires the protein Nipbl. We discuss how SMC complexes may perform their functions on chromatin in vivo.},

No evidence of the bacterial symbiont Wolbachia was found, and the observed system was compared with that in parasitoid wasps where asexuality is the result of Wolbachia infection.},

Sex determination in Nasonia is not governed by complementary alleles at one or more sex loci. As in most other insects, the sex-determining pathway consists of the basal switch doublesex that is sex-specifically regulated by transformer. Analysis of a polyploid and a mutant gynandromorphic strain, suggested a parent-specific effect (imprinting) on sex determination in Nasonia. Zygotic activity of transformer is autoregulated and depends on a combination of maternal provision of tra mRNA and a paternal genome set. This constitutes a novel way of transformer control in insect sex determination implying maternal imprinting. The nature of the maternal imprint is not yet known and it remains to be determined how broadly the Nasonia sex-determining mechanism applies to other haplodiploids.},

Sex determination in such haplodiploid species does not rely on a difference in heteromorphic sex chromosome composition but the genetic basis has been elucidated in some hymenopteran insects (wasps, sawflies, ants, bees). In these species, the development into one sex or the others depends on an initial signal whether there is only one allele or two different alleles of a single gene, the complementary sex determiner (csd ), in the zygotic genome. The gene has been most-recently identified in the honey bee and has been found to encode an arginine serine-rich (SR) type protein. Heterozygosity generates an active protein that initiates female development while hemizygosity/homozygosity results in a non-active CSD protein and default male development. I will discuss plausible models of how the molecular decision of male and female is made and implemented. Comparison to hierarchies of dipteran insects suggests that SR-type protein has facilitated the differentiation of sex-determining systems and hierarchies. BioEssays 26:1131\textendash 1139, 2004.},

The underlying mechanisms of sex determination, however, appear to be diverse and are poorly understood. We have dissected the complementary sex determiner (csd) locus in the honeybee to understand its molecular basis. In this species, csd acts as the primary sex-determining signal with several alleles segregating in populations. Males are hemizygous and females are heterozygous at this locus; nonreproducing diploid males occur when the locus is homozygous. We have characterized csd by positional cloning and repression analysis. csd alleles are highly variable and no transcription differences were found between sexes. These results establish csd as a primary signal that governs sexual development by its allelic composition. Structural similarity of csd with tra genes of Dipteran insects suggests some functional relation of what would otherwise appear to be unrelated sex-determination mechanisms.},

We have little understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which these absence/presence gene functions have evolved, because the phenotype and fitness of molecular intermediate forms are unknown. Here, we studied the sex-determining switch of 14 natural sequence variants of the csd gene among 76 genotypes of the honeybee (Apis mellifera). Heterozygous genotypes (different specificities) of the csd gene determine femaleness, while hemizygous genotypes (single specificity) determine maleness. Homozygous genotypes of the csd gene (same specificity) are lethal [1\textendash 6]. We found that at least five amino acid differences and length variation between Csd specificities in the specifying domain (PSD) were sufficient to regularly induce femaleness. We estimated that, on average, six pairwise amino acid differences evolved under positive selection [7\textendash 9]. We also identified a natural evolutionary intermediate that showed only three amino acid length differences in the PSD relative to its parental allele. This genotype showed an intermediate fitness because it implemented lethality regularly and induced femaleness infrequently (i.e., incomplete penetrance). We suggest incomplete penetrance as a mechanism through which new molecular switches can gradually and adaptively evolve.},

  abstract = {All hymenopteran species, such as bees, wasps and ants, are characterized by the common principle of haplodiploid sex determination in which haploid males arise from unfertilized eggs and females from fertilized eggs. The underlying molecular mechanism has been studied in detail in the western honey bee Apis mellifera, in which the gene complementary sex determiner (csd) acts as primary signal of the sex determining pathway, initiating female development by csd-heterozygotes. Csd arose from gene duplication of the feminizer (fem) gene, a transformer (tra) ortholog, and mediates in conjunction with transformer2 (tra2) sex-specific splicing of fem. Comparative molecular analyses identified fem/tra and its downstream target doublesex (dsx) as conserved unit within the sex determining pathway of holometabolous insects. In this study, we aim to examine evolutionary differences among these key regulators. Our main hypothesis is that sex determining key regulators in Hymenoptera species show signs of coevolution within single phylogenetic lineages. We take advantage of several newly sequenced genomes of bee species to test this hypothesis using bioinformatic approaches. We found evidences that duplications of fem are restricted to certain bee lineages and notable amino acid differences of tra2 between Apis and non-Apis species propose structural changes in Tra2 protein affecting co-regulatory function on target genes. These findings may help to gain deeper insights into the ancestral mode of hymenopteran sex determination and support the common view of the remarkable evolutionary flexibility in this regulatory pathway.},

  abstract = {Background: Cost effective next generation sequencing technologies now enable the production of genomic datasets for many novel planktonic eukaryotes, representing an understudied reservoir of genetic diversity. O. tauri is the smallest free-living photosynthetic eukaryote known to date, a coccoid green alga that was first isolated in 1995 in a lagoon by the Mediterranean sea. Its simple features, ease of culture and the sequencing of its 13 Mb haploid nuclear genome have promoted this microalga as a new model organism for cell biology. Here, we investigated the quality of genome assemblies of Illumina GAIIx 75 bp paired-end reads from Ostreococcus tauri, thereby also improving the existing assembly and showing the genome to be stably maintained in culture. Results: The 3 assemblers used, ABySS, CLCBio and Velvet, produced 95\% complete genomes in 1402 to 2080 scaffolds with a very low rate of misassembly. Reciprocally, these assemblies improved the original genome assembly by filling in 930 gaps. Combined with additional analysis of raw reads and PCR sequencing effort, 1194 gaps have been solved in total adding up to 460 kb of sequence. Mapping of RNAseq Illumina data on this updated genome led to a twofold reduction in the proportion of multi-exon protein coding genes, representing 19\% of the total 7699 protein coding genes. The comparison of the DNA extracted in 2001 and 2009 revealed the fixation of 8 single nucleotide substitutions and 2 deletions during the approximately 6000 generations in the lab. The deletions either knocked out or truncated two predicted transmembrane proteins, including a glutamate-receptor like gene. Conclusion: High coverage ({$>$}80 fold) paired-end Illumina sequencing enables a high quality 95\% complete genome assembly of a compact \textasciitilde 13 Mb haploid eukaryote. This genome sequence has remained stable for 6000 generations of lab culture.},

Given their impact on human health, Legionella species and the mechanisms responsible for their replication within host cells are often studied in alveolar macrophages, the primary human cell type associated with disease. Despite the potential severity of individual cases of disease, Legionella are not spread from person-to-person. Thus, from the pathogen's perspective, interactions with human cells are accidents of time and space\textemdash evolutionary dead ends with no impact on Legionella's long-term survival or pathogenic trajectory. To understand Legionella as a pathogen is to understand its interaction with its natural hosts: the polyphyletic protozoa, a group of unicellular eukaryotes with a staggering amount of evolutionary diversity. While much remains to be understood about these enigmatic hosts, we summarize the current state of knowledge concerning Legionella's natural host range, the diversity of Legionella-protozoa interactions, the factors influencing these interactions, the importance of avoiding the generalization of protozoan-bacterial interactions based on a limited number of model hosts and the central role of protozoa to the biology, evolution, and persistence of Legionella in the environment.},

  abstract = {Among eukaryotes, sexual reproduction is by far the most predominant mode of reproduction. However, some systems maintaining sexuality appear particularly labile and raise intriguing questions on the evolutionary routes to asexuality. Thelytokous parthenogenesis is a form of spontaneous loss of sexuality leading to strong distortion of sex ratio towards females and resulting from mutation, hybridization or infection by bacterial endosymbionts. We investigated whether ecological specialization is a likely mechanism of spread of thelytoky within insect communities. Focusing on the highly specialized genus Megastigmus (Hymenoptera: Torymidae), we first performed a large literature survey to examine the distribution of thelytoky in these wasps across their respective obligate host plant families. Second, we tested for thelytoky caused by endosymbionts by screening in 15 arrhenotokous and 10 thelytokous species for Wolbachia, Cardinium, Arsenophonus and Rickettsia endosymbionts and by performing antibiotic treatments. Finally, we performed phylogenetic reconstructions using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) to examine the evolution of endosymbiont-mediated thelytoky in Megastigmus and its possible connections to host plant specialization. We demonstrate that thelytoky evolved from ancestral arrhenotoky through the horizontal transmission and the fixation of the parthenogenesis-inducing Wolbachia. We find that ecological specialization in Wolbachia's hosts was probably a critical driving force for Wolbachia infection and spread of thelytoky, but also a constraint. Our work further reinforces the hypothesis that community structure of insects is a major driver of the epidemiology of endosymbionts and that competitive interactions among closely related species may facilitate their horizontal transmission.},

  abstract = {Adaptation to the host environment and exploitation of host cell functions are critical to the success of intracellular pathogens. Here, insight to these virulence mechanisms was obtained for the first time from the transcriptional program of the human pathogen Legionella pneumophila during infection of its natural host, Acanthamoeba castellanii. The biphasic life cycle of L. pneumophila was reflected by a major shift in gene expression from replicative to transmissive phase, concerning nearly half of the genes predicted in the genome. However, three different L. pneumophila strains showed similar in vivo gene expression patterns, indicating that common regulatory mechanisms govern the Legionella life cycle, despite the plasticity of its genome. During the replicative phase, in addition to components of aerobic metabolism and amino acid catabolism, the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, a NADPH producing mechanism used for sugar and/or gluconate assimilation, was expressed, suggesting for the first time that intracellular L. pneumophila may also scavenge host carbohydrates as nutrients and not only proteins. Identification of genes only upregulated in vivo but not in vitro, may explain higher virulence of in vivo grown L. pneumophila. Late in the life cycle, L. pneumophila upregulates genes predicted to promote transmission and manipulation of a new host cell, therewith priming it for the next attack. These including substrates of the Dot/Icm secretion system, other factors associated previously with invasion and virulence, the motility and the type IV pilus machineries, and {$>$} 90 proteins not characterized so far. Analysis of a fliA ({$\sigma$}28) deletion mutant identified genes coregulated with the flagellar regulon, including GGDEF/EAL regulators and factors that promote host cell entry and survival.},

  abstract = {The positioning of chromosomes in the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell is highly organized and has a complex and dynamic relationship with gene expression. In the human malaria parasite               Plasmodium falciparum               , the clustering of a family of virulence genes correlates with their coordinated silencing and has a strong influence on the overall organization of the genome. To identify conserved and species-specific principles of genome organization, we performed Hi-C experiments and generated 3D genome models for five               Plasmodium               species and two related apicomplexan parasites.               Plasmodium               species mainly showed clustering of centromeres, telomeres, and virulence genes. In               P. falciparum               , the heterochromatic virulence gene cluster had a strong repressive effect on the surrounding nuclear space, while this was less pronounced in               Plasmodium vivax               and               Plasmodium berghei               , and absent in               Plasmodium yoelii               . In               Plasmodium knowlesi               , telomeres and virulence genes were more dispersed throughout the nucleus, but its 3D genome showed a strong correlation with gene expression. The               Babesia microti               genome showed a classical Rabl organization with colocalization of subtelomeric virulence genes, while the               Toxoplasma gondii               genome was dominated by clustering of the centromeres and lacked virulence gene clustering. Collectively, our results demonstrate that spatial genome organization in most               Plasmodium               species is constrained by the colocalization of virulence genes.               P. falciparum               and               P. knowlesi               , the only two               Plasmodium               species with gene families involved in antigenic variation, are unique in the effect of these genes on chromosome folding, indicating a potential link between genome organization and gene expression in more virulent pathogens.},

  abstract = {A large number of highly pathogenic bacteria utilize secretion systems to translocate effector proteins into host cells. Using these effectors, the bacteria subvert host cell processes during infection. Legionella pneumophila translocates effectors via the Icm/Dot type-IV secretion system and to date, approximately 100 effectors have been identified by various experimental and computational techniques. Effector identification is a critical first step towards the understanding of the pathogenesis system in L. pneumophila as well as in other bacterial pathogens. Here, we formulate the task of effector identification as a classification problem: each L. pneumophila open reading frame (ORF) was classified as either effector or not. We computationally defined a set of features that best distinguish effectors from non-effectors. These features cover a wide range of characteristics including taxonomical dispersion, regulatory data, genomic organization, similarity to eukaryotic proteomes and more. Machine learning algorithms utilizing these features were then applied to classify all the ORFs within the L. pneumophila genome. Using this approach we were able to predict and experimentally validate 40 new effectors, reaching a success rate of above 90\%. Increasing the number of validated effectors to around 140, we were able to gain novel insights into their characteristics. Effectors were found to have low G+C content, supporting the hypothesis that a large number of effectors originate via horizontal gene transfer, probably from their protozoan host. In addition, effectors were found to cluster in specific genomic regions. Finally, we were able to provide a novel description of the C-terminal translocation signal required for effector translocation by the Icm/Dot secretion system. To conclude, we have discovered 40 novel L. pneumophila effectors, predicted over a hundred additional highly probable effectors, and shown the applicability of machine learning algorithms for the identification and characterization of bacterial pathogenesis determinants.},

  abstract = {In nature, Legionella pneumophila replicates exclusively as an intracellular parasite of amoebae, but it also persists in the environment as a free-living microbe. Studies of how this opportunistic pathogen recognizes and responds to distinct extracellular and intracellular environments identified a link between the growth phase and expression of traits previously correlated with virulence. When cultured in broth, only post-exponential-phase L. pneumophila was sodium sensitive, cytotoxic, osmotically resistant, competent to evade macrophage lysosomes, infectious, and motile. Likewise, the L. pneumophila phenotype changed during growth in macrophages. During the intracellular replication period, this bacterium was sodium resistant and lacked flagella; concomitant with macrophage lysis, L. pneumophilabecame sodium sensitive and flagellated. Expression of the virulent phenotype was a response to starvation, since exponential-phaseL. pneumophila became cytotoxic, sodium sensitive, and motile after incubation in broth from stationary-phase cultures, except when it was supplemented with amino acids. Together, these data indicate that while nutrients are plentiful, intracellularL. pneumophila organisms are dedicated to replication; when amino acids become limiting, the progeny express virulence factors to escape the spent host, to disperse and survive in the aquatic environment, and to reestablish a protected intracellular niche favorable for growth.},

We studied the role of SATB1 in regulating the coordinated expression of Il5, Il4 and Il13, located in the 200-kb T-helper 2 (TH2) cytokine locus on mouse chromosome 11. We show that on TH2 cell activation, SATB1 expression is rapidly induced to form a unique transcriptionally active chromatin structure at the cytokine locus. In this structure, chromatin is folded into numerous small loops, all anchored to SATB1 at their base. In addition, histone H3 is acetylated at Lys9 and Lys14, and the TH2-specific factors GATA3, STAT6 and c-Maf, the chromatin-remodeling enzyme Brg1 and RNA polymerase II are all bound across the 200-kb region. Before activation, the TH2 cytokine locus is already associated with GATA3 and STAT6, showing some looping, but these are insufficient to induce cytokine gene expression. Using RNA interference, we show that on cell activation, SATB1 is required not only for compacting chromatin into dense loops at the 200-kb cytokine locus but also for inducing Il4, Il5, Il13 and c-Maf expression. Thus, SATB1 is a necessary determinant for the hitherto unidentified higher-order, transcriptionally active chromatin structure that forms on TH2 cell activation.},

GITAR is composed of two main modules: (1) HiCtool, a Python library to process and visualize Hi-C data, including TAD analysis; and (2) processed data library, a large collection of human and mouse datasets processed using HiCtool. HiCtool leads the user step-by-step through a pipeline, which goes from the raw Hi-C data to the computation, visualization, and optimized storage of intra-chromosomal contact matrices and TAD coordinates. A large collection of standardized processed data allows the users to compare different datasets in a consistent way, while saving time to obtain data for visualization or additional analyses. More importantly, GITAR enables users without any programming or bioinformatic expertise to work with Hi-C data. GITAR is publicly available at http://genomegitar.org as an open-source software.},

Recently, genome-wide methods identified an intermediate level of chromosome organization, topologically associating domains (TADs), that play key roles in transcriptional regulation. However, these methods cannot directly examine the interplay between transcriptional activation and chromosome architecture while maintaining spatial information. Here we present a multiplexed, sequential imaging approach (Hi-M) that permits simultaneous detection of chromosome organization and transcription in single nuclei. This allowed us to unveil the changes in 3D chromatin organization occurring upon transcriptional activation and homologous chromosome unpairing during awakening of the zygotic genome in intact Drosophila embryos. Excitingly, the ability of Hi-M to explore the multi-scale chromosome architecture with spatial resolution at different stages of development or during the cell cycle will be key to understanding the mechanisms and consequences of the 4D organization of the genome.},

Within this organization, Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) are visible in Hi-C heat maps at the sub-megabase scale. The integrity of TADs is important for correct gene expression, but in a context-dependent and variable manner. The correct structure and function of TADs require the binding of the CTCF protein at both borders, which appears to block an active and dynamic mechanism of ``Cohesin-mediated loop extrusion.'' As a result, mammalian TADs appear as so-called ``loop domains'' in Hi-C data, which are the focus of this review. Here, we present a reanalysis of TADs from three ``golden-standard'' mammalian Hi-C data sets. Despite the prominent presence of TADs in Hi-C heat maps from all studies, we find consistently that regions within these domains are only moderately insulated from their surroundings. Moreover, single-cell Hi-C and superresolution microscopy have revealed that the structure of TADs and the position of their borders can vary from cell to cell. The function of TADs as units of gene regulation may thus require additional aspects, potentially incorporating the mechanism of loop extrusion as well. Recent developments in single-cell and multi-contact genomics and superresolution microscopy assays will be instrumental to link TAD formation and structure to their function in transcriptional regulation.},

Here, we present the first high-resolution contact map of Drosophila neuronal cells (BG3) and identify different classes of TADs by comparing this to genome organization in embryonic cells (Kc167). We find that only some TADs are conserved in both cell lines, whereas the rest are cell-type\textendash specific. This is supported by a change in the enrichment of architectural proteins at TAD borders, with BEAF-32 present in embryonic cells and CTCF in neuronal cells. Furthermore, we observe strong divergent transcription, together with RNA Polymerase II occupancy and an increase in DNA accessibility at the TAD borders. TAD borders that are specific to neuronal cells are enriched in enhancers controlled by neuronal-specific transcription factors. Our results suggest that TADs are dynamic across developmental stages and reflect the interplay between insulators, transcriptional states, and enhancer activities.},

  abstract = {Acanthamoeba are ubiquitous phagocytes predominant in soil and water which can ingest many microbes. Giant viruses of amoebae are listed among the Acanthamoebaresisting microorganisms. Their sympatric lifestyle within amoebae is suspected to promote lateral nucleotide sequence transfers. Some Acanthamoeba species have shown differences in their susceptibility to giant viruses. Until recently, only the genome of a single Acanthamoeba castellanii Neff was available. We analyzed the draft genome sequences of Acanthamoeba polyphaga through several approaches, including comparative genomics, phylogeny, and sequence networks, with the aim of detecting putative nucleotide sequence exchanges with giant viruses. We identified a putative sequence trafficking between this Acanthamoeba species and giant viruses, with 366 genes best matching with viral genes. Among viruses, Pandoraviruses provided the greatest number of best hits with 117 (32\%) for A. polyphaga. Then, genes from mimiviruses, Mollivirus sibericum, marseilleviruses, and Pithovirus sibericum were best hits in 67 (18\%), 35 (9\%), 24 (7\%), and 2 (0.5\%) cases, respectively. Phylogenetic reconstructions showed in a few cases that the most parsimonious evolutionary scenarios were a transfer of gene sequences from giant viruses to A. polyphaga. Nevertheless, in most cases, phylogenies were inconclusive regarding the sense of the sequence flow. The number and nature of putative nucleotide sequence transfers between A. polyphaga, and A. castellanii ATCC 50370 on the one hand, and pandoraviruses, mimiviruses and marseilleviruses on the other hand were analyzed. The results showed a lower number of differences within the same giant viral family compared to between different giant virus families. The evolution of 10 scaffolds that were identified among the 14 Acanthamoeba sp. draft genome sequences and that harbored {$\geq$} 3 genes best matching with viruses showed a conservation of these scaffolds and their 46 viral genes in A. polyphaga, A. castellanii ATCC 50370 and A. pearcei. In contrast, the number of conserved genes decreased for other Acanthamoeba species, and none of these 46 genes were present in three of them. Overall, this work opens up several potential avenues for future studies on the interactions between Acanthamoeba species and giant viruses.},

However, existing algorithms either collapse heterozygous alleles into one consensus copy or fail to cleanly separate the haplotypes to produce high-quality phased assemblies. Here we describe hifiasm, a de novo assembler that takes advantage of long high-fidelity sequence reads to faithfully represent the haplotype information in a phased assembly graph. Unlike other graph-based assemblers that only aim to maintain the contiguity of one haplotype, hifiasm strives to preserve the contiguity of all haplotypes. This feature enables the development of a graph trio binning algorithm that greatly advances over standard trio binning. On three human and five nonhuman datasets, including California redwood with a \textasciitilde 30-Gb hexaploid genome, we show that hifiasm frequently delivers better assemblies than existing tools and consistently outperforms others on haplotype-resolved assembly.},

We used the public epigenomic data from human fibroblast IMR90 cell and embryonic stem cell (H1) to develop and test CITD, which can not only successfully reconstruct the chromatin interaction frequencies discovered by the Hi-C technology, but also provide additional novel details of chromosomal organizations. We predicted the chromatin interaction frequencies, topological domains and their states (e.g. active or repressive) for 98 additional cell types from Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE projects. A total of 131 proteincoding genes located near 78 preserved boundaries among 100 cell types are found to be significantly enriched in functional categories of the nucleosome organization and chromatin assembly. CITD and its predicted results can be used for complementing the topological domains derived from limited Hi-C data and facilitating the understanding of spatial principles underlying the chromosomal organization.},

Traditional genotype imputation methods are typically based on haplotype-clustering algorithms, hidden Markov models (HMMs), and statistical inference. Deep learning-based methods have been recently reported to suitably address the missing data problems in various fields. To explore the performance of deep learning for genotype imputation, in this study, we propose a deep model called a sparse convolutional denoising autoencoder (SCDA) to impute missing genotypes. We constructed the SCDA model using a convolutional layer that can extract various correlation or linkage patterns in the genotype data and applying a sparse weight matrix resulted from the L1 regularization to handle high dimensional data. We comprehensively evaluated the performance of the SCDA model in different scenarios for genotype imputation on the yeast and human genotype data, respectively. Our results showed that SCDA has strong robustness and significantly outperforms popular reference-free imputation methods. This study thus points to another novel application of deep learning models for missing data imputation in genomic studies.},

  abstract = {Post-translational modifications (PTM) decorate proteins to provide functional heterogeneity to an existing proteome. The large number of known PTMs highlights the many ways that cells can modify their proteins to respond to diverse stimuli. Recently, PTMs have begun to receive increased interest because new sensitive proteomics workflows and structural methodologies now allow researchers to obtain large-scale, in-depth and unbiased information concerning PTM type and site localization. However, few PTMs have been extensively assessed for functional consequences, leaving a large knowledge gap concerning the inner workings of the cell. Here, we review understanding of N-{$\mathsl{E}$}-lysine acetylation in bacteria, a PTM that was largely ignored in bacteria until a decade ago. Acetylation is a modification that can dramatically change the function of a protein through alteration of its properties, including hydrophobicity, solubility, and surface properties, all of which may influence protein conformation and interactions with substrates, cofactors and other macromolecules. Most bacteria carry genes predicted to encode the lysine acetyltransferases and lysine deacetylases that add and remove acetylations, respectively. Many bacteria also exhibit acetylation activities that do not depend on an enzyme, but instead on direct transfer of acetyl groups from the central metabolites acetyl coenzyme A or acetyl phosphate. Regardless of mechanism, most central metabolic enzymes possess lysines that are acetylated in a regulated fashion and many of these regulated sites are conserved across the spectrum of bacterial phylogeny. The interconnectedness of acetylation and central metabolism suggests that acetylation may be a response to nutrient availability or the energy status of the cell. However, this and other hypotheses related to acetylation remain untested.},

At an early stage of IFN{$\gamma$} induction, chromatin carrying the entire MHC locus loops out from the chromosome 6 territory. We show here that JAK/STAT signalling triggers this higher-order chromatin remodelling and the entire MHC locus becomes decondensed prior to transcriptional activation of the classical HLA class II genes. A single point mutation of STAT1 that prevents phosphorylation is sufficient to abolish chromatin remodelling, thus establishing a direct link between the JAK/STAT signalling pathway and human chromatin architecture. The onset of chromatin remodelling corresponds with the binding of activated STAT1 and the chromatin remodelling enzyme BRG1 at specific sites within the MHC, and is followed by RNA-polymerase recruitment and histone hyperacetylation. We propose that the higher-order chromatin remodelling of the MHC locus is an essential step to generate a transcriptionally permissive chromatin environment for subsequent activation of classical HLA genes.},

Here we present an analysis of a whole genome assembly of Acanthamoeba castellanii (Ac) the first representative from a solitary freeliving amoebozoan. Results: Ac encodes 15,455 compact intron-rich genes, a significant number of which are predicted to have arisen through inter-kingdom lateral gene transfer (LGT). A majority of the LGT candidates have undergone a substantial degree of intronization and Ac appears to have incorporated them into established transcriptional programs. Ac manifests a complex signaling and cell communication repertoire, including a complete tyrosine kinase signaling toolkit and a comparable diversity of predicted extracellular receptors to that found in the facultatively multicellular dictyostelids. An important environmental host of a diverse range of bacteria and viruses, Ac utilizes a diverse repertoire of predicted pattern recognition receptors, many with predicted orthologous functions in the innate immune systems of higher organisms. Conclusions: Our analysis highlights the important role of LGT in the biology of Ac and in the diversification of microbial eukaryotes. The early evolution of a key signaling facility implicated in the evolution of metazoan multicellularity strongly argues for its emergence early in the Unikont lineage. Overall, the availability of an Ac genome should aid in deciphering the biology of the Amoebozoa and facilitate functional genomic studies in this important model organism and environmental host.},

Although it is dear that a duplication can arise and become fixed in a population purely by random genetic drift and that the rate of fixation is accelerated If the duplication is directly advantageous, the nature of gene duplication suggests that other factors may influence the fate of a novel duplication. In the face of disadvantageous loss-offunction mutations, duplication of a functional gene may provide a buffer against such mutations. Here the conditions for invasion of a rare duplication starting from a mutatinselection balance are derived with formal population genetic models in both hapolds and diploids. Recurrent duplication protects the duplicated chromosome from loss and can be very effective in increasing its frequency in a population. In the absence of recurrent duplication, one migt suppose that a dupliation would be favored by natural section because it can mask the effects of deleterious mutations. However, the models show that a duplication can invade only if it provides a direct advantage to the organism. This result Is closely related to recent theoretical work on the evolution of ploidy.},

Despite active investigation of the roles of these factors, a genome-wide view of dynamic chromosome architecture at both small and large scale during cell division is still missing. Here, we report the first comprehensive 4D analysis of the higher-order organization of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome throughout the cell cycle and investigate the roles of SMC complexes in controlling structural transitions. During replication, cohesion establishment promotes numerous long-range intra-chromosomal contacts and correlates with the individualization of chromosomes, which culminates at metaphase. In anaphase, mitotic chromosomes are abruptly reorganized depending on mechanical forces exerted by the mitotic spindle. Formation of a condensin-dependent loop bridging the centromere cluster with the rDNA loci suggests that condensin-mediated forces may also directly facilitate segregation. This work therefore comprehensively recapitulates cell cycle-dependent chromosome dynamics in a unicellular eukaryote, but also unveils new features of chromosome structural reorganization during highly conserved stages of cell division.},

  abstract = {Chromatin conformation assays such as Hi-C cannot directly measure differences in 3D architecture between cell types or cell states. For this purpose, two or more Hi-C experiments must be carried out, but direct comparison of the resulting Hi-C matrices is confounded by several features of Hi-C data. Most notably, the genomic distance effect, whereby contacts between pairs of genomic loci that are proximal along the chromosome exhibit many more Hi-C contacts that distal pairs of loci, dominates every Hi-C matrix. Furthermore, the form that this distance effect takes often varies between different Hi-C experiments, even between replicate experiments. Thus, a statistical confidence measure designed to identify differential Hi-C contacts must accurately account for the genomic distance effect or risk being misled by large-scale but artifactual differences. ACCOST (Altered Chromatin COnformation STatistics) accomplishes this goal by extending the statistical model employed by DEseq, re-purposing the `size factors,' which were originally developed to account for differences in read depth between samples, to instead model the genomic distance effect. We show via analysis of simulated and real data that ACCOST provides unbiased statistical confidence estimates that compare favorably with competing methods such as diffHiC, FIND~and HiCcompare.

High-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become the main option for these studies. Thus, the number of methods and softwares for differential expression analysis from RNA-Seq data also increased rapidly. However, there is no consensus about the most appropriate pipeline or protocol for identifying differentially expressed genes from RNA-Seq data. This work presents an extended review on the topic that includes the evaluation of six methods of mapping reads, including pseudo-alignment and quasi-mapping and nine methods of differential expression analysis from RNA-Seq data. The adopted methods were evaluated based on real RNA-Seq data, using qRT-PCR data as reference (gold-standard). As part of the results, we developed a software that performs all the analysis presented in this work, which is freely available at https://github.com/costasilvati/consexpression. The results indicated that mapping methods have minimal impact on the final DEGs analysis, considering that adopted data have an annotated reference genome. Regarding the adopted experimental model, the DEGs identification methods that have more consistent results were the limma +voom, NOIseq and DESeq2. Additionally, the consensus among five DEGs identification methods guarantees a list of DEGs with great accuracy, indicating that the combination of different methods can produce more suitable results. The consensus option is also included for use in the available software.},

Several studies have suggested a role in stabilizing specific 3D genomic contacts. To test this hypothesis, we exploited interchromosomal contacts frequencies obtained from Hi-C experiments and show that the folding of the human, mouse and Drosophila genomes is associated with a significant co-localization of several specific repetitive elements, notably many elements of the SINE family. These repeats tend to be the oldest ones and are enriched in transcription factor binding sites. We propose that the co-localization of these repetitive elements may explain the global conservation of genome folding observed between homologous regions of the human and mouse genome. Taken together, these results support a contribution of specific repetitive elements in maintaining and/or reshaping genome architecture over evolutionary times.},

  abstract = {Background: Chromatin organization has been increasingly studied in relation with its important influence on DNA-related metabolic processes such as replication or regulation of gene expression. Since its original design ten years ago, capture of chromosome conformation (3C) has become an essential tool to investigate the overall conformation of chromosomes. It relies on the capture of long-range trans and cis interactions of chromosomal segments whose relative proportions in the final bank reflect their frequencies of interactions, hence their spatial proximity in a population of cells. The recent coupling of 3C with deep sequencing approaches now allows the generation of high resolution genome-wide chromosomal contact maps. Different protocols have been used to generate such maps in various organisms. This includes mammals, drosophila and yeast. The massive amount of raw data generated by the genomic 3C has to be carefully processed to alleviate the various biases and byproducts generated by the experiments. Our study aims at proposing a simple normalization procedure to minimize the influence of these unwanted but inevitable events on the final results. Results: Careful analysis of the raw data generated previously for budding yeast S. cerevisiae led to the identification of three main biases affecting the final datasets, including a previously unknown bias resulting from the circularization of DNA molecules. We then developed a simple normalization procedure to process the data and allow the generation of a normalized, highly contrasted, chromosomal contact map for S. cerevisiae. The same method was then extended to the first human genome contact map. Using the normalized data, we revisited the preferential interactions originally described between subsets of discrete chromosomal features. Notably, the detection of preferential interactions between tRNA in yeast and CTCF, PolII binding sites in human can vary with the normalization procedure used. Conclusions: We quantitatively reanalyzed the genomic 3C data obtained for S. cerevisiae, identified some of the biases inherent to the technique and proposed a simple normalization procedure to analyse them. Such an approach can be easily generalized for genomic 3C experiments in other organisms. More experiments and analysis will be necessary to reach optimal resolution and accuracies of the maps generated through these approaches. Working with cell population presenting highest levels of homogeneity will prove useful in this regards.},

These regulatory events at enhancers contribute to the specific gene expression programs that determine cell state and the potential for differentiation into new cell types. Although enhancer elements are known to be associated with certain histone modifications and transcription factors, the relationship of these modifications to gene expression and developmental state has not been clearly defined. Here we interrogate the epigenetic landscape of enhancer elements in embryonic stem cells and several adult tissues in the mouse. We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone. This indicates that the amount of actively used enhancers is lower than previously anticipated. Furthermore, poised enhancer networks provide clues to unrealized developmental programs. Finally, we show that enhancers are reset during nuclear reprogramming.},

Expression of insulator CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) was found to be required for expression of all MHC class II genes associated with antigen presentation. Ten CTCF sites that divide the MHC-II locus into apparent evolutionary domains were identified. To define the role of CTCF in mediating regulation of the MHC II genes, chromatin conformation capture assays, which provide an architectural assessment of a locus, were conducted across the MHC-II region. Depending on whether MHC-II genes and the class II transactivator (CIITA) were being expressed, two CTCF-dependent chromatin architectural states, each with multiple configurations and interactions, were observed. These states included the ability to express MHC-II gene promoter regions to interact with nearby CTCF sites and CTCF sites to interact with each other. Thus, CTCF organizes the MHC-II locus into a novel basal architecture of interacting foci and loop structures that rearranges in the presence of CIITA. Disruption of the rearranged states eradicated expression, suggesting that the formation of these structures is key to coregulation of MHC-II genes and the locus.},

Recent reports convey the prevalence and diversity of enhancer transcription and transcripts and support both as key factors with mechanistically distinct, but not mutually exclusive roles in enhancer function. Decoupling the causes and effects of transcription on the local chromatin landscape and understanding the role of enhancer transcripts in the context of long-range interactions are challenges that require additional attention. In this review we focus on the possible functions of enhancer transcription by highlighting several recent eRNA papers and, within the context of other enhancer studies, speculate on the role of enhancer transcription in regulating differential gene expression.},

  abstract = {Legionella pneumophila is an environmental bacterium and the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease. Previous genomic studies have shown that recombination accounts for a high proportion ({$>$}96\%) of diversity within several major disease-associated sequence types (STs) of L. pneumophila. This suggests that recombination represents a potentially important force shaping adaptation and virulence. Despite this, little is known about the biological effects of recombination in L. pneumophila, particularly with regards to homologous recombination (whereby genes are replaced with alternative allelic variants). Using newly available population genomic data, we have disentangled events arising from homologous and nonhomologous recombination in six major disease-associated STs of L. pneumophila (subsp. pneumophila), and subsequently performed a detailed characterisation of the dynamics and impact of homologous recombination. We identified genomic ``hotspots'' of homologous recombination that include regions containing outer membrane proteins, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) region and Dot/Icm effectors, which provide interesting clues to the selection pressures faced by L. pneumophila. Inference of the origin of the recombined regions showed that isolates have most frequently imported DNA from isolates belonging to their own clade, but also occasionally from other major clades of the same subspecies. This supports the hypothesis that the possibility for horizontal exchange of new adaptations between major clades of the subspecies may have been a critical factor in the recent emergence of several clinically important STs from diverse genomic backgrounds. However, acquisition of recombined regions from another subspecies, L. pneumophila subsp. fraseri, was rarely observed, suggesting the existence of a recombination barrier and/or the possibility of ongoing speciation between the two subspecies. Finally, we suggest that multi-fragment recombination may occur in L. pneumophila, whereby multiple non-contiguous segments that originate from the same molecule of donor DNA are imported into a recipient genome during a single episode of recombination.},

One important but understudied area in infectious disease research is the role of nuclear architecture or the physical arrangement of the genome in the nucleus in controlling gene regulation and pathogenicity. Recent advances in research methods, such as Genome-wide chromosome conformation capture using highthroughput sequencing (Hi-C), have allowed for easier analysis of nuclear architecture and chromosomal reorganization in both the infectious disease agents themselves as well as in their host cells. This review will discuss broadly on what is known about nuclear architecture in infectious disease, with an emphasis on chromosomal reorganization, and briefly discuss what steps are required next in the field.},

  abstract = {Despite its fundamental role in development, sex determination is highly diverse among animals. Approximately 20\% of all animals are haplodiploid, with haploid males and diploid females. Haplodiploid species exhibit diverse but poorly understood mechanisms of sex determination. Some hymenopteran insect species exhibit single-locus complementary sex determination (sl-CSD), where heterozygosity at a polymorphic sex locus initiates female development. Diploid males are homozygous at the sex locus and represent a genetic load because they are inviable or sterile. Inbreeding depression associated with CSD is therefore expected to select for other modes of sex determination resulting in fewer or no diploid males. Here, we investigate an alternative, heretofore hypothetical, mode of sex determination: multiple-locus CSD (ml-CSD). Under ml-CSD, diploid males are predicted to develop only from zygotes that are homozygous at all sex loci. We show that inbreeding for eight generations in the parasitoid wasp Cotesia vestalis leads to increasing proportions of diploid males, a pattern that is consistent with ml-CSD but not sl-CSD. The proportion of diploid males (0.27 6 0.036) produced in the first generation of inbreeding (mother\textendash son cross) suggests that two loci are likely involved. We also modeled diploid male production under CSD with three linked loci. Our data visually resemble CSD with linked loci because diploid male production in the second generation was lower than that in the first. To our knowledge, our data provide the first experimental support for ml-CSD.},

Methods: We compared lung, tongue, and cecal bacteria in forty healthy, genetically-identical 10-week old mice using 16S rRNA gene quantification and sequencing. We measured inflammatory cytokines using a multiplex assay of homogenized lung tissue. We compared lung bacteria in healthy mice treated with varied durations of systemic antibiotics. Measurements and Main Results: Lung bacterial communities are highly variable among mice, cluster strongly by cage, by shipment, and by vendor, and are altered by antibiotics in a microbiologically predictable manner. Baseline lung concentrations of two key inflammatory cytokines (IL-1{$\alpha$}, IL-4) are correlated with the diversity and community composition of lung bacterial communities. Lung concentrations of these inflammatory cytokines correlated more strongly with variation in lung bacterial communities than with that of the gut or mouth. Conclusions: In the lungs of healthy mice, baseline innate immune tone more strongly reflects local (lung-lung) microbe-host interactions than remote (gut-lung) microbe-host interactions. Our results independently confirm the existence and immunologic significance of the murine lung microbiome, even in health. Variation in lung microbiota is likely an important, underappreciated source of experimental and clinical variability. The lung microbiome is an unexplored therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory lung disease.},

Surveillance of water systems is based on microbiological culture-based techniques; however, it has been shown that high percentages of the Legionella populations in water systems are not culturable. In the past two decades, the relevance of such viable but non-culturable (VBNC) legionellae has been controversially discussed, and whether VBNC legionellae can directly infect human macrophages, the primary targets of Legionella infections, remains unclear. In this study, it was demonstrated for the first time that several starved VBNC Legionella strains (four L. pneumophila serogroup 1 strains, a serogroup 6 strain and a L. micdadei strain) can directly infect different types of human macrophages and amoebae even after one year of starvation in ultrapure water. However, under these conditions, the strains caused infection with reduced efficacy, as represented by the lower percentages of infected cells, prolonged time in co-culture and higher multiplicities of infection required. Interestingly, the VBNC cells remained mostly nonculturable even after multiplication within the host cells. Amoebal infection by starved VBNC Legionella, which likely occurs in oligotrophic biofilms, would result in an increase in the bacterial concentration in drinking-water systems. If cells remain in the VBNC state, the real number of active legionellae will be underestimated by the use of culture-based standard techniques. Thus, further quantitative research is needed in order to determine, whether and how many starved VBNC Legionella cells are able to cause disease in humans.},

At higher resolution, the chromosomes of these plants can be further partitioned to local A/B compartments that reflect their euchromatin, heterochromatin, and polycomb status. Chromatins in all these plants are organized into domains that are not conserved across species. They show similarity to the Drosophila compartment domains, and are clustered into active, polycomb, repressive, and intermediate types based on their transcriptional activities and epigenetic signatures, with domain border overlaps with the local A/B compartment junctions. In the large maize and tomato genomes, we observed extensive chromatin loops. However, unlike the mammalian chromatin loops that are enriched at the TAD border, plant chromatin loops are often formed between gene islands outside the repressive domains~and are closely associated with active compartments. Our study indicates that plants have complex and unique 3D chromatin architectures, which require~further study to elucidate their biological functions.},

Cohesin also influences gene expression, and relative to sister chromatid cohesion, gene expression is exquisitely sensitive to moderate changes in cohesin activity.

Both cohesin and condensin II are associated with genes in euchromatin and not heterochromatin. The two SMC complexes and the SMC loading factor NIPBL are particularly enriched at super-enhancers, and the genes associated with these regulatory elements are especially sensitive to reduced levels of these complexes.

  abstract = {The classic model of eukaryotic gene expression requires direct spatial contact between a distal enhancer and a proximal promoter. Recent Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) studies show that enhancers and promoters are embedded in a complex network of looping interactions. Here we use a polymer model of chromatin fiber to investigate whether, and to what extent, looping interactions between elements in the vicinity of an enhancer-promoter pair can influence their contact frequency. Our equilibrium polymer simulations show that a chromatin loop, formed by elements flanking either an enhancer or a promoter, suppresses enhancer-promoter interactions, working as an insulator. A loop formed by elements located in the region between an enhancer and a promoter, on the contrary, facilitates their interactions. We find that different mechanisms underlie insulation and facilitation; insulation occurs due to steric exclusion by the loop, and is a global effect, while facilitation occurs due to an effective shortening of the enhancer-promoter genomic distance, and is a local effect. Consistently, we find that these effects manifest quite differently for in silico 3C and microscopy. Our results show that looping interactions that do not directly involve an enhancer-promoter pair can nevertheless significantly modulate their interactions. This phenomenon is analogous to allosteric regulation in proteins, where a conformational change triggered by binding of a regulatory molecule to one site affects the state of another site.},

  abstract = {Background. Legionella pneumophila is a causative agent of severe pneumonia. Infection leads to a broad host cell response, as evident, for example, on the transcriptional level. Chromatin modifications, which control gene expression, play a central role in the transcriptional response to L. pneumophila. Methods. We infected human-blood-derived macrophages (BDMs) with L. pneumophila and used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing to screen for gene promoters with the activating histone 4 acetylation mark. Results. We found the promoter of tumor necrosis factor {$\alpha$}\textendash induced protein 2 (TNFAIP2) to be acetylated at histone H4. This factor has not been characterized in the pathology of L. pneumophila. TNFAIP2 messenger RNA and protein were upregulated in response to L. pneumophila infection of human-BDMs and human alveolar epithelial (A549) cells. We showed that L. pneumophila\textendash induced TNFAIP2 expression is dependent on the NF-{$\kappa$}B transcription factor. Importantly, knock down of TNFAIP2 led to reduced intracellular replication of L. pneumophila Corby in A549 cells. Conclusions. Taken together, genome-wide chromatin analysis of L. pneumophila\textendash infected macrophages demonstrated induction of TNFAIP2, a NF-{$\kappa$}B\textendash dependent factor relevant for bacterial replication.},

  abstract = {Many tools have been developed for haplotype assembly - the reconstruction of individual haplotypes using reads mapped to a reference genome sequence. Due to increasing interest in obtaining haplotyperesolved human genomes, a range of new sequencing protocols and technologies have been developed to enable the reconstruction of whole-genome haplotypes. However, existing computational methods designed to handle specific technologies do not scale well on data from different protocols. We describe a new algorithm, HapCUT2, that extends our previous method (HapCUT) to handle multiple sequencing technologies. Using simulations and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from multiple different data types \textendash{} dilution pool sequencing, linked-read sequencing, single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing, and proximity ligation (Hi-C) sequencing \textendash{} we show that HapCUT2 rapidly assembles haplotypes with best-in-class accuracy for all data types. In particular, HapCUT2 scales well for high sequencing coverage and rapidly assembled haplotypes for two long-read WGS datasets on which other methods struggled. Further, HapCUT2 directly models Hi-C specific error modalities resulting in significant improvements in error rates compared to HapCUT, the only other method that could assemble haplotypes from Hi-C data. Using HapCUT2, haplotype assembly from a 90\texttimes{} coverage whole-genome Hi-C dataset yielded high-resolution haplotypes (78.6\% of variants phased in a single block) with high pairwise phasing accuracy ({$\sim$} 98\% across chromosomes). Our results demonstrate that HapCUT2 is a robust tool for haplotype assembly applicable to data from diverse sequencing technologies.},

A human genome is assembled in under 10~min using 8 cores and 10 GB RAM, and 60 Gbp of metagenome reads are assembled in 4~min using 1 GB RAM. In addition, we constructed a minimizer-space de Bruijn graph-based representation of 661,405 bacterial genomes, comprising 16 million nodes and 45 million edges, and successfully search it for anti-microbial resistance (AMR) genes in 12~min.

Aspects of this gene reprogramming suggest the involvement of epigenetic processes. We used THP-1 human promonocytes, which mimic gene silencing when rendered endotoxin-tolerant in vitro, to test whether TNF{$\alpha$} proximal promoter nucleosomes and transcription factors adapt to an activation-specific profile by developing characteristic chromatin-based silencing marks. We found increased TNF{$\alpha$} mRNA levels in endotoxin-responsive cells that was preceded by dissociation of heterochromatin-binding protein 1{$\alpha$}, demethylation of nucleosomal histone H3 lysine 9 (H3(Lys9)), increased phosphorylation of the adjacent serine 10 (H3(Ser10)), and recruitment of NF-{$\kappa$}B RelA/p65 to the TNF{$\alpha$} promoter. In contrast, endotoxintolerant cells repressed production of TNF{$\alpha$} mRNA, retained binding of heterochromatin-binding protein 1{$\alpha$}, sustained methylation of H3(Lys9), reduced phosphorylation of H3(Ser10), and showed diminished binding of NF-{$\kappa$}B RelA/p65 to the TNF{$\alpha$} promoter. Similar levels of NF-{$\kappa$}B p50 occurred at the TNF{$\alpha$} promoter in the basal state, during active transcription, and in the silenced phenotype. RelB, which acts as a repressor of TNF{$\alpha$} transcription, remained bound to the promoter during silencing. These results support an immunodeficiency paradigm where epigenetic changes at the promoter of acute proinflammatory genes mediate their repression during the late phase of severe systemic inflammation.},

  abstract = {Background: The first generation of genome sequence assemblies and annotations have had a significant impact upon our understanding of the biology of the sequenced species, the phylogenetic relationships among species, the study of populations within and across species, and have informed the biology of humans. As only a few Metazoan genomes are approaching finished quality (human, mouse, fly and worm), there is room for improvement of most genome assemblies. The honey bee (Apis mellifera) genome, published in 2006, was noted for its bimodal GC content distribution that affected the quality of the assembly in some regions and for fewer genes in the initial gene set (OGSv1.0) compared to what would be expected based on other sequenced insect genomes. Results: Here, we report an improved honey bee genome assembly (Amel\_4.5) with a new gene annotation set (OGSv3.2), and show that the honey bee genome contains a number of genes similar to that of other insect genomes, contrary to what was suggested in OGSv1.0. The new genome assembly is more contiguous and complete and the new gene set includes \textasciitilde 5000 more protein-coding genes, 50\% more than previously reported. About 1/6 of the additional genes were due to improvements to the assembly, and the remaining were inferred based on new RNAseq and protein data. Conclusions: Lessons learned from this genome upgrade have important implications for future genome sequencing projects. Furthermore, the improvements significantly enhance genomic resources for the honey bee, a key model for social behavior and essential to global ecology through pollination.},

We first address long-standing questions regarding the structure of embryonic homolog pairing and, to this end, develop a haplotype-resolved Hi-C approach to minimize homolog misassignment and thus robustly distinguish               trans               -homolog from               cis               contacts.

We also find a significant genome-wide correlation between pairing, transcription during zygotic genome activation, and binding of the pioneer factor Zelda. Our findings reveal a complex, highly structured organization underlying homolog pairing, first discovered a century ago in               Drosophila               .

Several similarities are seen in the L. pneumophila-infection cycle in both hosts, suggesting that the tools necessary for macrophage infection may have evolved during co-evolution of L. pneumophila and amoeba. The establishment of the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) within the host cytoplasm requires the remodeling of the LCV surface and the hijacking of vesicles and organelles. Then L. pneumophila replicates in a safe intracellular niche in amoeba and macrophages. In this review we will summarize the existing knowledge of the L. pneumophila infection cycle in both hosts at the molecular level and compare the factors involved within amoeba and macrophages. This knowledge will be discussed in the light of recent findings from the Acanthamoeba castellanii genome analyses suggesting the existence of a primitive immune-like system in amoeba.},

  abstract = {The intracellular bacteria Legionella pneumophila encodes a type IV secretion system (T4SS) that injects effector proteins into macrophages in order to establish and replicate within the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV). Once generated, the LCV interacts with mitochondria through unclear mechanisms. We show that Legionella uses both T4SS-independent and T4SS-dependent mechanisms to respectively interact with mitochondria and induce mitochondrial fragmentation that ultimately alters mitochondrial metabolism. The T4SS effector MitF, a Ran GTPase activator, is required for fission of the mitochondrial network. These effects of MitF occur through accumulation of mitochondrial DNM1L, a GTPase critical for fission. Furthermore mitochondrial respiration is abruptly halted in a T4SS-dependent manner, while T4SS-independent upregulation of cellular glycolysis remains elevated. Collectively, these alterations in mitochondrial dynamics promote a Warburg-like phenotype in macrophages that favors bacterial replication. Hence the rewiring of cellular bioenergetics to create a replication permissive niche in host cells is a virulence strategy of L. pneumophila.},

Here, we discuss the state-of-the-art knowledge on metabolic reprogramming of host cells upon activation or infection with intracellular bacteria. The study of the host-driven and pathogen-driven metabolic alterations that seem to co-exist during infection is an emerging field that will define the metabolic pathways that might be targeted to combat infection.},

  abstract = {Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, a severe pneumonia, injects via a type-IV-secretion-system (T4SS) more than 300 proteins into macrophages, its main host cell in humans. Certain of these proteins are implicated in reprogramming the metabolism of infected cells by reducing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) early after infection. Here we show that despite reduced OXPHOS, the mitochondrial membrane potential ({$\Delta\psi$}m) is maintained during infection of primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs). We reveal that L. pneumophila reverses the ATP-synthase activity of the mitochondrial FOF1-ATPase to ATP-hydrolase activity in a T4SS-dependent manner, which leads to a conservation of the {$\Delta\psi$}m, preserves mitochondrial polarization and prevents macrophage cell death. Analyses of T4SS effectors known to target mitochondrial functions revealed that LpSpl is partially involved in conserving the {$\Delta\psi$}m, but not LncP and MitF. The inhibition of the L. pneumophila-induced ``reverse mode'' of the FOF1-ATPase collapsed the {$\Delta\psi$}m and caused cell death in infected cells. Single-cell analyses suggested that bacterial replication occurs preferentially in hMDMs that conserved the {$\Delta\psi$}m and showed delayed cell death. This direct manipulation of the mode of activity of the FOF1-ATPase is a newly identified feature of L. pneumophila allowing to delay host cell death and thereby to preserve the bacterial replication niche during infection.},

  abstract = {Pathogenic bacteria evade host defences by subverting host signalling pathways in many different and sophisticated ways. An intriguing strategy used by several pathogens, mainly intracellular bacteria, is molecular or structural mimicry of host proteins.In the past few years, studies have revealed that some pathogenic bacteria secret specific proteins via their type 3 secretion systems (T3SSs) and type 4 secretion systems (T4SSs) to target host organelles. These proteins contain organelle localization signals that target the effectors, for example to the nucleus or the mitochondria.Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia trachomatis and Burkholderia thailandensis secrete SET domain-containing proteins that encode histone methyltransferase activity to directly impose epigenetic changes on the chromatin landscape of the host cell, thus aiding bacterial intracellular replication.Listeria monocytogenes, pathogenic Escherichia coli strains and Shigella flexneri secrete specific effector proteins that change the levels of chromatin-binding proteins to indirectly alter the host chromatin to the advantage of the pathogen.Membrane dynamics, and in particular the eukaryotic secretory pathway, are targeted by bacterial pathogens to allow them to form a distinct replication-permissive vacuole inside the host cell. Legionella spp. and Brucella spp. target endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vesicles and the retrograde traffic between the Golgi and the ER; Salmonella spp. and Chlamydia spp. interact with the trans-Golgi network or associated compartments.To target the ER or Golgi network, different secreted effectors evolved to specifically hijack RAB proteins and exploit phosphoinositide lipids, which are phosphorylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol.Mitochondria are the power plants of the cell, but are also involved in essential cellular processes such as programmed cell death, calcium homeostasis, and the biosynthesis of amino acids, lipids and nucleotides. They also serve as hubs for innate immune signalling against viruses and bacteria.L. pneumophila, enteropathogenic E. coli, Vibrio cholerae and Anaplasma phagocytophilum have been reported to secrete diverse effectors that target mitochondria, mainly to inhibit inflammatory responses.},

The causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, the {$\gamma$}-proteobacterium Legionella pneumophila, resides and replicates within a modified vacuole of protozoan and mammalian cells. L. pneumophila translocates effector proteins into host cells through the Icm-Dot complex, a specialized type IVB secretion system that is required for intracellular growth. To find out if some effector proteins may have been acquired through interdomain horizontal gene transfer (HGT), we performed a bioinformatic screen that searched for eukaryotic motifs in all open reading frames of the L. pneumophila Philadelphia-1 genome. We found 44 uncharacterized genes with many distinct eukaryotic motifs. Most of these genes contain G+C biases compared to other L. pneumophila genes, supporting the theory that they were acquired through HGT. Furthermore, we found that several of them are expressed and up-regulated in stationary phase in an RpoS-dependent manner. In addition, at least seven of these gene products are translocated into host cells via the Icm-Dot complex, confirming their role in the intracellular environment. Reminiscent of the case with most Icm-Dot substrates, most of the strains containing mutations in these genes grew comparably to the parent strain intracellularly. Our findings suggest that in L. pneumophila, interdomain HGT may have been a major mechanism for the acquisition of determinants of infection.},

A major limitation of Hi-C is the sequencing depth required to robustly detect loops in the data. A popular approach used to mitigate this issue, even in single-cell Hi-C data, is genome-wide averaging (piling-up) of peaks, or other features, annotated in high-resolution datasets, to measure their prominence in less deeply sequenced data. However, current tools do not provide a computationally efficient and versatile implementation of this approach.Here, we describe coolpup.py\textemdash a versatile tool to perform pile-up analysis on Hi-C data. We demonstrate its utility by replicating previously published findings regarding the role of cohesin and CTCF in 3D genome organization, as well as discovering novel details of Polycomb-driven interactions. We also present a novel variation of the pile-up approach that can aid the statistical analysis of looping interactions. We anticipate that coolpup.py will aid in Hi-C data analysis by allowing easy to use, versatile and efficient generation of pile-ups.Coolpup.py is cross-platform, open-source and free (MIT licensed) software.

  abstract = {The origin of organismal complexity is generally thought to be tightly coupled to the evolution of new gene functions arising subsequent to gene duplication. Under the classical model for the evolution of duplicate genes, one member of the duplicated pair usually degenerates within a few million years by accumulating deleterious mutations, while the other duplicate retains the original function. This model further predicts that on rare occasions, one duplicate may acquire a new adaptive function, resulting in the preservation of both members of the pair, one with the new function and the other retaining the old. However, empirical data suggest that a much greater proportion of gene duplicates is preserved than predicted by the classical model. Here we present a new conceptual framework for understanding the evolution of duplicate genes that may help explain this conundrum. Focusing on the regulatory complexity of eukaryotic genes, we show how complementary degenerative mutations in different regulatory elements of duplicated genes can facilitate the preservation of both duplicates, thereby increasing long-term opportunities for the evolution of new gene functions. The duplication-degeneration-complementation (DDC) model predicts that (1) degenerative mutations in regulatory elements can increase rather than reduce the probability of duplicate gene preservation and (2) the usual mechanism of duplicate gene preservation is the partitioning of ancestral functions rather than the evolution of new functions. We present several examples (including analysis of a new engrailed gene in zebrafish) that appear to be consistent with the DDC model, and we suggest several analytical and experimental approaches for determining whether the complementary loss of gene subfunctions or the acquisition of novel functions are likely to be the primary mechanisms for the preservation of gene duplicates.},

The type IVB Icm/Dot secretion system is necessary for the translocation of effector proteins that modulate vesicle trafficking pathways in the host cell, thus avoiding phagosome-lysosome fusion. The Legionella VipA effector was previously identified by its ability to interfere with organelle trafficking in the Multivesicular Body (MVB) pathway when ectopically expressed in yeast. In this study, we show that VipA binds actin in vitro and directly polymerizes microfilaments without the requirement of additional proteins, displaying properties distinct from other bacterial actin nucleators. Microscopy studies revealed that fluorescently tagged VipA variants localize to puncta in eukaryotic cells. In yeast these puncta are associated with actin-rich regions and components of the Multivesicular Body pathway such as endosomes and the MVB-associated protein Bro1. During macrophage infection, native translocated VipA associated with actin patches and early endosomes. When ectopically expressed in mammalian cells, VipA-GFP displayed a similar distribution ruling out the requirement of additional effectors for binding to its eukaryotic targets. Interestingly, a mutant form of VipA, VipA-1, that does not interfere with organelle trafficking is also defective in actin binding as well as association with early endosomes and shows a homogeneous cytosolic localization. These results show that the ability of VipA to bind actin is related to its association with a specific subcellular location as well as its role in modulating organelle trafficking pathways. VipA constitutes a novel type of actin nucleator that may contribute to the intracellular lifestyle of Legionella by altering cytoskeleton dynamics to target host cell pathways.},

Here, we investigate TAD higher-order interactions with Hi-C through neuronal differentiation and show that they form a hierarchy of domains-within-domains (metaTADs) extending across genomic scales up to the range of entire chromosomes. We find that TAD interactions are well captured by tree-like, hierarchical structures irrespective of cell type. metaTAD tree structures correlate with genetic, epigenomic and expression features, and structural tree rearrangements during differentiation are linked to transcriptional state changes. Using polymer modelling, we demonstrate that hierarchical folding promotes efficient chromatin packaging without the loss of contact specificity, highlighting a role far beyond the simple need for packing efficiency.},

We characterized new mutant alleles of the genes encoding the core subunits of this complex, smc2-8 and smc4-1. Both SMC2 and SMC4 are essential for chromosome transmission in anaphase. Mutations in these genes cause defects in establishing condensation of unique (chromosome VIII arm) and repetitive (rDNA) regions of the genome but do not impair sister chromatid cohesion. In vivo localization of Smc4p fused to green fluorescent protein showed that, unexpectedly, in S. cerevisiae the condensin complex concentrates in the rDNA region at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. rDNA segregation in mitosis is delayed and/or stalled in smc2 and smc4 mutants, compared with separation of pericentromeric and distal arm regions. Mitotic transmission of chromosome III carrying the rDNA translocation is impaired in smc2 and smc4 mutants. Thus, the condensin complex in S. cerevisiae has a specialized function in mitotic segregation of the rDNA locus. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis revealed that condensin is physically associated with rDNA in vivo. Thus, the rDNA array is the first identified set of DNA sequences specifically bound by condensin in vivo. The biological role of higher-order chromosome structure in S. cerevisiae is discussed.},

Some unicellular eukaryotes, however, have been reported to have fewer kMTs than chromosomes [1\textendash 5]. If this is the case, it is unclear how the spindle checkpoint could be satisfied. In the vast majority of the previous studies, mitotic cells were chemically fixed at room temperature, but this does not always preserve dynamic and/or small structures like spindle MTs and kinetochores [6]. Indeed, later higher-resolution studies have reversed some earlier claims [7\textendash 11]. Here we show that in Ostreococcus tauri (the smallest eukaryote known), mitosis does involve fewer spindle microtubules than chromosomes. O. tauri cultures were enriched for mitotic cells, high-pressure frozen, and then imaged in 3D both in plastic and in a near-native (``frozen-hydrated'') state through electron tomography. Mitotic cells have a distinctive intranuclear heterochromatin-free ``spindle tunnel'' with approximately four short and occasionally one long, incomplete (unclosed) microtubule at each end of the spindle tunnel. Because other aspects of O. tauri 's spindle checkpoint seem typical, these data suggest that O. tauri 's 20 chromosomes are physically linked and segregated as just one or a small number of groups.},

  abstract = {Cohesin is a regulator of genome architecture with roles in sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome compaction. The recruitment and mobility of cohesin complexes on DNA is restricted by nucleosomes. Here we show that the role of cohesin in chromosome organisation requires the histone chaperone FACT in S. cerevisiae. We find that FACT interacts directly with cohesin, and is dynamically required for its localization on chromatin. Depletion of FACT in metaphase cells prevents cohesin accumulation at pericentric regions and causes reduced binding on chromosome arms. Using Hi-C, we show that cohesin-dependent TAD (Topological Associated Domains)-like structures in G1 and metaphase chromosomes are reduced in the absence of FACT. Sister chromatid cohesion is intact in FACT-depleted cells, although chromosome segregation failure is observed. Our data shows that FACT contributes to the formation of cohesin-dependent TADs thus uncovering a new role for this complex in nuclear organisation during interphase and mitotic chromosome folding.},

  abstract = {Organisms have evolved a bewildering diversity of mechanisms to generate the two sexes. The honeybee (Apis mellifera) employs an interesting system in which sex is determined by heterozygosity at a single locus (the Sex Determination Locus) harbouring the complementary sex determiner (csd) gene. Bees heterozygous at Sex Determination Locus are females, whereas bees homozygous or hemizygous are males. Little is known, however, about the regulation that links sex determination to sexual differentiation. To investigate the control of sexual development in honeybees, we analyzed the functions and the regulatory interactions of genes involved in the sex determination pathway. We show that heterozygous csd is only required to induce the female pathway, while the feminizer (fem) gene maintains this decision throughout development. By RNAi induced knockdown we show that the fem gene is essential for entire female development and that the csd gene exclusively processes the heterozygous state. Fem activity is also required to maintain the female determined pathway throughout development, which we show by mosaic structures in fem-repressed intersexuals. We use expression of Fem protein in males to demonstrate that the female maintenance mechanism is controlled by a positive feedback splicing loop in which Fem proteins mediate their own synthesis by directing female fem mRNA splicing. The csd gene is only necessary to induce this positive feedback loop in early embryogenesis by directing splicing of fem mRNAs. Finally, fem also controls the splicing of Am-doublesex transcripts encoding conserved male- and female-specific transcription factors involved in sexual differentiation. Our findings reveal how the sex determination process is realized in honeybees differing from Drosophila melanogaster.},

  abstract = {Transcription factors bind in a combinatorial fashion to specify the on-and-off states of genes; the ensemble of these binding events forms a regulatory network, constituting the wiring diagram for a cell. To examine the principles of the human transcriptional regulatory network, we determined the genomic binding information of 119 transcription-related factors in over 450 distinct experiments. We found the combinatorial, co-association of transcription factors to be highly context specific: distinct combinations of factors bind at specific genomic locations. In particular, there are significant differences in the binding proximal and distal to genes. We organized all the transcription factor binding into a hierarchy and integrated it with other genomic information (for example, microRNA regulation), forming a dense meta-network. Factors at different levels have different properties; for instance, top-level transcription factors more strongly influence expression and middle-level ones co-regulate targets to mitigate information-flow bottlenecks. Moreover, these co-regulations give rise to many enriched network motifs (for example, noise-buffering feed-forward loops). Finally, more connected network components are under stronger selection and exhibit a greater degree of allele-specific activity (that is, differential binding to the two parental alleles). The regulatory information obtained in this study will be crucial for interpreting personal genome sequences and understanding basic principles of human biology and disease.},

  abstract = {Redundancy has been referred to as a state of no longer being needed or useful. Microbiologists often theorize that the only case of true redundancy in a haploid organism would be a recent gene duplication event, prior to divergence through selective pressure. However, a growing number of examples exist where an organism encodes two genes that appear to perform the same function. For example, many pathogens translocate multiple effector proteins into hosts. While disruption of individual effector genes does not result in a discernable phenotype, deleting genes in combination impairs pathogenesis: this has been described as redundancy. In many cases, this apparent redundancy could be due to limitations of laboratory models of pathogenesis that do not fully recapitulate the disease process. Alternatively, it is possible that the selective advantage achieved by this perceived redundancy is too subtle to be measured in the laboratory. Moreover, there are numerous possibilities for different types of redundancy. The most common and recognized form of redundancy is functional redundancy whereby two proteins have similar biochemical activities and substrate specificities allowing each one to compensate in the absence of the other. However, redundancy can also exist between seemingly unrelated proteins that manipulate the same or complementary host cell pathways. In this article, we outline 5 types of redundancy in pathogenesis: molecular, target, pathway, cellular process, and system redundancy that incorporate the biochemical activities, the host target specificities and the impact of effector function on the pathways and cellular process they modulate. For each type of redundancy, we provide examples from Legionella pathogenesis as this organism employs over 300 secreted virulence proteins and loss of individual proteins rarely impacts intracellular growth. We also discuss selective pressures that drive the maintenance of redundant mechanisms, the current methods used to resolve redundancy and features that distinguish between redundant and non-redundant virulence mechanisms.},

During prometaphase, \textasciitilde 80-kb inner loops are nested within \textasciitilde 400-kb outer loops. The loop array acquires a helical arrangement with consecutive loops emanating from a central ``spiral staircase'' condensin scaffold. The size of helical turns progressively increases to \textasciitilde 12 megabases during prometaphase. Acute depletion of condensin I or II shows that nested loops form by differential action of the two condensins, whereas condensin II is required for helical winding.},

Open chromatin fibers correlate with regions of highest gene density, but not with gene expression since inactive genes can be in domains of open chromatin, and active genes in regions of low gene density can be embedded in compact chromatin fibers. Moreover, we show that chromatin fiber structure impacts on further levels of chromatin condensation. Regions of open chromatin fibers are cytologically decondensed and have a distinctive nuclear organization. We suggest that domains of open chromatin may create an environment that facilitates transcriptional activation and could provide an evolutionary constraint to maintain clusters of genes together along chromosomes.},

The establishment and publication of the complete genome sequences of L. pneumophila and L. longbeachae isolates paved the way for major breakthroughs in understanding the biology of these organisms. In this review we present the knowledge gained from the analyses and comparison of the complete genome sequences of different L. pneumophila and L. longbeachae strains. Emphasis is given on putative virulence and Legionella life cycle related functions, such as the identification of an extended array of eukaryotic like proteins, many of which have been shown to modulate host cell functions to the pathogen's advantage.

Compelling evidence for the importance of protozoa in the evolution of this bacterium comes from analysis of complete genome sequences.

The genus               Legionella               comprises 65 species for which aquatic amoebae are the natural reservoirs. Using functional and comparative genomics to deconstruct the entire bacterial genus we reveal the surprising parallel evolutionary trajectories that have led to the emergence of human pathogenic               Legionella.               An unexpectedly large and unique repository of secreted proteins ({$>$}16,000) containing eukaryotic-like proteins acquired from all domains of life (plant, animal, fungal, archaea) is contrasting with a highly conserved type 4 secretion system. This study reveals an unprecedented environmental reservoir of bacterial virulence factors, and provides a new understanding of how reshuffling and gene-acquisition from environmental eukaryotic hosts, may allow for the emergence of human pathogens.                                                Abstract                            The bacterial genus               Legionella               comprises 65 species among, which               Legionella pneumophila               is a human pathogen causing severe pneumonia. To understand the evolution of an environmental to an accidental human pathogen, we have functionally analyzed 80               Legionella               genomes spanning 58 species. Uniquely, an immense repository of 16,000 secreted proteins encoding 137 different eukaryotic-like domains and more than 200 eukaryotic-like proteins is paired with a highly conserved T4SS. Specifically, we show that eukaryotic Rho and Rab GTPase domains are found nearly exclusively in eukaryotes and               Legionella               species. Translocation assays for selected Rab-GTPase proteins revealed that they are indeed T4SS secreted substrates. Furthermore, F/U-box and SET domains were present in {$>$}70\% of all species suggesting that manipulation of host signal transduction, protein turnover and chromatin modification pathways, respectively are fundamental intracellular replication strategies for               Legionellae               . In contrast, the Sec-7 domain was restricted to               L. pneumophila               and seven other species, indicating effector repertoire tailoring within different amoebae. Functional screening of 47 species revealed 60\% were competent for intracellular replication in THP-1 cells, but interestingly this phenotype was associated with diverse effector assemblages. These data, combined with evolutionary analysis indicate that the capacity to infect eukaryotic cells has been acquired independently many times within the genus and that a highly conserved yet versatile T4SS secretes an exceptional number of different proteins shaped by inter-domain gene transfer. Furthermore we revealed the surprising extent to which legionellae have co-opted genes and thus cellular functions from their eukaryotic hosts and provides a new understanding of how dynamic reshuffling and gene-acquisition has led to the emergence of major human pathogens.},

  abstract = {The genus               Legionella               comprises 65 species, among which               Legionella pneumophila               is a human pathogen causing severe pneumonia. To understand the evolution of an environmental to an accidental human pathogen, we have functionally analyzed 80               Legionella               genomes spanning 58 species. Uniquely, an immense repository of 18,000 secreted proteins encoding 137 different eukaryotic-like domains and over 200 eukaryotic-like proteins is paired with a highly conserved type IV secretion system (T4SS). Specifically, we show that eukaryotic Rho- and Rab-GTPase domains are found nearly exclusively in eukaryotes and               Legionella               . Translocation assays for selected Rab-GTPase proteins revealed that they are indeed T4SS secreted substrates. Furthermore, F-box, U-box, and SET domains were present in {$>$}70\% of all species, suggesting that manipulation of host signal transduction, protein turnover, and chromatin modification pathways are fundamental intracellular replication strategies for legionellae. In contrast, the Sec-7 domain was restricted to               L. pneumophila               and seven other species, indicating effector repertoire tailoring within different amoebae. Functional screening of 47 species revealed 60\% were competent for intracellular replication in THP-1 cells, but interestingly, this phenotype was associated with diverse effector assemblages. These data, combined with evolutionary analysis, indicate that the capacity to infect eukaryotic cells has been acquired independently many times within the genus and that a highly conserved yet versatile T4SS secretes an exceptional number of different proteins shaped by interdomain gene transfer. Furthermore, we revealed the surprising extent to which legionellae have coopted genes and thus cellular functions from their eukaryotic hosts, providing an understanding of how dynamic reshuffling and gene acquisition have led to the emergence of major human pathogens.},

Although mated queens always produce females sexually, if workers lay unfertilized eggs the eggs develop into diploid females via thelytokous parthenogenesis. Thelytoky in A. m. capensis has given rise to an entirely clonal lineage of reproductive parasites that infests colonies of their neighbouring subspecies A. m. scutellata. The switch from arrhenotoky to thelytokous worker reproduction is thought to be determined by a recessive allele at a single locus. However, it has recently been shown that this simple phenotype/genotype association may be more complex because individuals from the parasitic clonal lineage produce c.a. 15 \% of eggs arrhenotokously and 85 \% of eggs thelytokously. Here, we investigate the fate of these arrhenotokous eggs and show that they can develop into adult males. We further show that workers of the sexual A. m. capensis population produce far fewer arrhenotokous eggs. We discuss possible evolutionary explanations for this difference.},

SPF chickens injected with S. enteritidis were partitioned into two groups, one consisted of those from Salmonella-susceptible chickens (died within 5 d after injection, n = 6), the other consisted of six Salmonella-resistant chickens that survived for 15 d after injection. The present study shows that the bacterial load in susceptible chickens was significantly higher than that in resistant chickens and TLR4, TLR2-1 and TLR21 expression was strongly diminished in the leukocytes of susceptible chickens compared with those of resistant chickens. The induction of expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, IL-6 and IFN-{$\beta$}, was greatly enhanced in the resistant but not in susceptible chickens. Contrasting with the reduced expression of TLR genes, those of the zinc finger protein 493 (ZNF493) gene and Toll-interacting protein (TOLLIP) gene were enhanced in the susceptible chickens. Finally, the expression of TLR4 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected in vitro with S. enteritidis increased significantly as a result of treatment with 5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dc) while either 5-Aza-dc or trichostatin A was effective in up-regulating the expression of TLR21 and TLR2-1. DNA methylation, in the predicted promoter region of TLR4 and TLR21 genes, and an exonic CpG island of the TLR2-1 gene was significantly higher in the susceptible chickens than in resistant chickens. Taken together, the results demonstrate that ZNF493-related epigenetic modification in leukocytes probably accounts for increased susceptibility to S. enteritidis in chickens by diminishing the expression and response of TLR4, TLR21 and TLR2-1.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY Free-living amoebae feed on bacteria, fungi, and algae. However, some microorganisms have evolved to become resistant to these protists. These amoeba-resistant microorganisms include established pathogens, such as Cryptococcus neoformans, Legionella spp., Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycobacterium avium, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Francisella tularensis, and emerging pathogens, such as Bosea spp., Simkania negevensis, Parachlamydia acanthamoebae, and Legionella-like amoebal pathogens. Some of these amoeba-resistant bacteria (ARB) are lytic for their amoebal host, while others are considered endosymbionts, since a stable host-parasite ratio is maintained. Free-living amoebae represent an important reservoir of ARB and may, while encysted, protect the internalized bacteria from chlorine and other biocides. Free-living amoebae may act as a Trojan horse, bringing hidden ARB within the human ``Troy,'' and may produce vesicles filled with ARB, increasing their transmission potential. Free-living amoebae may also play a role in the selection of virulence traits and in adaptation to survival in macrophages. Thus, intra-amoebal growth was found to enhance virulence, and similar mechanisms seem to be implicated in the survival of ARB in response to both amoebae and macrophages. Moreover, free-living amoebae represent a useful tool for the culture of some intracellular bacteria and new bacterial species that might be potential emerging pathogens.},

We also describe a nuclear structure, termed KNOT, in which genomic regions of all five Arabidopsis chromosomes interact. These KNOT ENGAGED ELEMENT (KEE) regions represent heterochromatic islands within euchromatin. Similar to PIWI-interacting RNA clusters, such as flamenco in Drosophila, KEEs represent preferred landing sites for transposable elements, which may be part of a transposon defense mechanism in the Arabidopsis nucleus.},

  abstract = {Alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota have profound effects on human health. Consequently, there is great interest in identifying, characterizing, and understanding factors that initiate these changes. Despite their high prevalence, studies have only recently begun to investigate how viral lung infections have an impact on the gut microbiota. There is also considerable interest in whether the gut microbiota could be manipulated during vaccination to improve efficacy. In this highly controlled study, we aimed to establish the effect of viral lung infection on gut microbiota composition and the gut environment using mouse models of common respiratory pathogens respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus. This was then compared to the effect of live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) vaccination. Both RSV and influenza virus infection resulted in significantly altered gut microbiota diversity, with an increase in Bacteroidetes and a concomitant decrease in Firmicutes phyla abundance. Although the increase in the Bacteroidetes phylum was consistent across several experiments, differences were observed at the family and operational taxonomic unit level. This suggests a change in gut conditions after viral lung infection that favors Bacteroidetes outgrowth but not individual families. No change in gut microbiota composition was observed after LAIV vaccination, suggesting that the driver of gut microbiota change is specific to live viral infection. Viral lung infections also resulted in an increase in fecal lipocalin-2, suggesting low-grade gut inflammation, and colonic Muc5ac levels. Owing to the important role that mucus plays in the gut environment, this may explain the changes in microbiota composition observed. This study demonstrates that the gut microbiota and the gut environment are altered following viral lung infections and that these changes are not observed during vaccination. Whether increased mucin levels and gut inflammation drive, or are a result of, these changes is still to be determined.},

  abstract = {CTCF and the associated cohesin complex play a central role in insulator function and higher-order chromatin organization of mammalian genomes. Recent studies identified a correlation between the orientation of CTCF-binding sites (CBSs) and chromatin loops. To test the functional significance of this observation, we combined CRISPR/Cas9-based genomicDNA-fragment editing with chromosome-conformation-capture experiments to show that the location and relative orientations of CBSs determine the specificity of long-range chromatin looping in mammalian genomes, using protocadherin (Pcdh) and b-globin as model genes. Inversion of CBS elements within the Pcdh enhancer reconfigures the topology of chromatin loops between the distal enhancer and target promoters and alters gene-expression patterns. Thus, although enhancers can function in an orientation-independent manner in reporter assays, in the native chromosome context, the orientation of at least some enhancers carrying CBSs can determine both the architecture of topological chromatin domains and enhancer/promoter specificity. These findings reveal how 3D chromosome architecture can be encoded by linear genome sequences.},

An open reading frame that is approximately 60\% identical to the               E. coli rpoS               gene was identified. Western blot analysis showed that the level of               L. pneumophila               RpoS increased in stationary phase. An insertion mutation was constructed in the               rpoS               gene on the chromosome of               L. pneumophila               , and the ability of this mutant strain to survive various stress conditions was assayed and compared with results for the wild-type strain. Both the mutant and wild-type strains were more resistant to stress when in stationary phase than when in the logarithmic phase of growth. This finding indicates that               L. pneumophila               RpoS is not required for a stationary-phase-dependent resistance to stress. Although the mutant strain was able to kill HL-60- and THP-1-derived macrophages, it could not replicate within a protozoan host,               Acanthamoeba castellanii               . These data suggest that               L. pneumophila               possesses a growth phase-dependent resistance to stress that is independent of RpoS control and that RpoS likely regulates genes that enable it to survive in the environment within protozoa. Our data indicate that the role of               rpoS               in               L. pneumophila               is very different from what has previously been reported for               E. coli rpoS               .},

However, its exact role is only partly known. To elucidate how CsrA impacts               L. pneumophila               metabolism we analysed the CsrA depended regulation of metabolic functions by comparative               13               C-isotopologue profiling and oxygen consumption experiments of a               L. pneumophila               wild-type (wt) strain and its isogenic                                csrA                 -                              mutant. We show that a                                csrA                 -                              mutant has significantly lower respiration rates when serine, alanine, pyruvate, {$\alpha$}-ketoglutarate or palmitate is the sole carbon source. By contrast, when grown in glucose or glycerol, no differences in respiration were detected. Isotopologue profiling uncovered that the transfer of label from [U-               13               C               3               ]serine via pyruvate into the citrate cycle and gluconeogenesis was lower in the mutant as judged from the labelling patterns of protein-derived amino acids, cell-wall-derived diaminopimelate, sugars and amino sugars and 3-hydroxybutyrate derived from polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). Similarly, the incorporation of [U-               13               C               6               ]glucose via the glycolysis/Entner\textendash Doudoroff (ED) pathway but not via the pentose phosphate pathway was repressed in the                                csrA                 -                              mutant. On the other hand, fluxes due to [U-               13               C               3               ]glycerol utilization were increased in the               csrA               -               mutant.

Thus, CsrA has a determining role in substrate usage and carbon partitioning during the               L. pneumophila               life cycle and regulates a switch from amino acid usage in replicative phase to glycerolipid usage during transmissive growth.},

We discuss recent progress in the understanding of the genetic and cytoplasmic mechanisms that make arrhenotoky possible. The best-understood mode of sex determination in the Hymenoptera is complementary sex determination (CSD), in which diploid males are produced under conditions of inbreeding. The gene mediating CSD has recently been cloned in the honey bee and has been named the complementary sex determiner. However, CSD is only known from 4 of 21 hymenopteran superfamilies, with some taxa showing clear evidence of the absence of CSD. Sex determination in the model hymenopteran Nasonia vitripennis does not involve CSD, but it is consistent with a form of genomic imprinting in which activation of the female developmental pathway requires paternally derived genes. Some other hymenopterans are not arrhenotokous but instead exhibit thelytoky or paternal genome elimination.},

PU.1 binding initiates nucleosome remodeling, followed by H3K4 monomethylation at large numbers of genomic regions associated with both broadly and specifically expressed genes. These locations serve as beacons for additional factors, exemplified by liver X receptors, which drive both cell-specific gene expression and signal-dependent responses. Together with analyses of transcription factor binding and H3K4me1 patterns in other cell types, these studies suggest that simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors can specify the genomic sites ultimately responsible for both cell identity and cell type-specific responses to diverse signaling inputs.},

We present the first phylogenetic analysis of the superfamily based on both morphological and molecular data. A web-based, systematics workbench mx was used to score 945 character states illustrated by 648 figures for 233 morphological characters for a total of 66 645 observations for 300 taxa. The matrix covers 22 chalcidoid families recognized herein and includes 268 genera within 78 of 83 subfamilies. Morphological data were analysed alone and in combination with molecular data from ribosomal 18S (2105 bp) and 28S D2\textendash D5 expansion regions (1812 bp). Analyses were analysed alone and in combined datasets using implied-weights parsimony and likelihood. Proposed changes in higher classification resulting from the analyses include: (i) recognition of Eriaporidae, revised status; (ii) recognition of Cynipencyrtidae, revised status; (iii) recognition of Azotidae, revised status; (iv) inclusion of Sycophaginae in Agaonidae, revised status; (v) reclassification of Aphelinidae to include Aphelininae, Calesinae, Coccophaginae, Eretmocerinae and Eriaphytinae; (vi) inclusion of Cratominae and Panstenoninae within Pteromalinae (Pteromalidae), new synonymy; (vii) inclusion of Epichrysomallinae in Pteromalidae, revised status. At a higher level, Chalcidoidea was monophyletic, with Mymaridae the sister group of Rotoitidae plus the remaining Chalcidoidea. A eulophid lineage was recovered that included Aphelinidae, Azotidae, Eulophidae, Signiphoridae, Tetracampidae and Trichogrammatidae. Eucharitidae and Perilampidae were monophyletic if Eutrichosomatinae (Pteromalidae) was included, and Eupelmidae was monophyletic if Oodera (Pteromalidae: Cleonyminae) was included. Likelihood recovered a clade of Eupelmidae + (Tanaostigmatidae + (Cynipencyrtus + Encyrtidae). Support for other lineages and their impact on the classification of Chalcidoidea is discussed.

  abstract = {Bacteria of the genus Legionella persist in a wide range of environmental habitats, including biofilms, protozoa and nematodes. Legionellaceae are `accidental' human pathogens that upon inhalation cause a severe pneumonia termed `Legionnaires' disease'. The interactions of L. pneumophila with eukaryotic hosts are governed by the Icm/Dot type IV secretion system (T4SS) and more than 150 `effector proteins', which subvert signal transduction pathways and promote the formation of the replication-permissive `Legionella-containing vacuole'. The Icm/Dot T4SS is essential to infect free-living protozoa, such as the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, as well as the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, or mammalian macrophages. To adapt to different niches, L. pneumophila not only responds to exogenous cues, but also to endogenous signals, such as the {$\alpha$}-hydroxyketone compound LAI-1 (Legionella autoinducer-1). The long-term adaptation of Legionella spp. is based on extensive horizontal DNA transfer. In fact, Legionella spp. have acquired canonical `genomic islands' of prokaryotic origin, but also a number of eukaryotic genes. Since many aspects of Legionella virulence against environmental predators and immune phagocytes are similar, an understanding of Legionella ecology provides valuable insights into the pathogenesis of legionellaceae for humans.},

While traditional, feature-based methods for RNA classification are limited by current scientific knowledge, deep learning methods can independently discover complex biological rules in the data de novo. We trained a gated recurrent neural network (RNN) on human messenger RNA (mRNA) and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) sequences. Our model, mRNA RNN (mRNN), surpasses state-of-the-art methods at predicting protein-coding potential despite being trained with less data and with no prior concept of what features define mRNAs. To understand what mRNN learned, we probed the network and uncovered several context-sensitive codons highly predictive of coding potential. Our results suggest that gated RNNs can learn complex and long-range patterns in full-length human transcripts, making them ideal for performing a wide range of difficult classification tasks and, most importantly, for harvesting new biological insights from the rising flood of sequencing data.},

Two main subsets of polarized macrophages have been described.

In this study, we investigated the motility and force generation of primary human macrophages polarized down the M1 and M2 pathways using chemokinesis assays and traction force microscopy on polyacrylamide gels. We found that M1 macrophages are significantly less motile and M2 macrophages are significantly more motile than unactivated M0 macrophages. We also showed that M1 macrophages generate significantly less force than M0 or M2 macrophages. We further found that M0 and M2, but not M1, macrophage force generation is dependent on ROCK signaling, as identified using the chemical inhibitor Y27632. Finally, using the chemical inhibitor blebbistatin, we found that myosin contraction is required for force generation by M0, M1, and M2 macrophages. This study represents the first investigation of the changes in the mechanical motility mechanisms used by macrophages after polarization.},

  abstract = {Originally described by the late evolutionary biologist Leigh Van Valen, the Red Queen hypothesis posits that the evolutionary arms race between hosts and their pathogens selects for discrete, genetically encoded events that lead to competitive advantages over the other species. Examples of immune evasion strategies are seen throughout the co-evolution of the mammalian immune system and pathogens, such as the enzymatic inactivation of nuclear factor-{$\kappa$}B signaling or host translation by pathogen-encoded virulence factors. Such immunoevasive maneuvers would be expected to select for the evolution of innate immune counterstrategies. Recent advances in our understanding of host immunity and microbial pathogenesis have provided insight into a particular innate immune adaptation, termed bystander activation. Bystander activation occurs as a consequence of infected cells alerting and instructing neighboring uninfected cells to produce inflammatory mediators, either through direct cell contact or paracrine signals. Thus, bystander activation can allow the immune system to overcome the ability of pathogens to disarm immune signaling in directly infected cells. This review presents an overview of the general hallmarks of bystander activation and their emerging role in innate immunity to intracellular pathogens, as well as examples of recent mechanistic discoveries relating to the bystander activation during infection with specific pathogens relevant to human health and disease.},

Physical domains contain different types of chromatin defined by the presence of specific proteins and epigenetic marks, with active chromatin preferentially located at the borders and silenced chromatin in the interior. Domain boundaries participate in long-range interactions that may contribute to~the clustering of regions of active or silenced chromatin in the nucleus. Analysis of transgenes suggests that chromatin is more accessible and permissive to transcription at the borders than inside domains, independent of the presence of active or silencing histone modifications. These results suggest that the higher-order physical organization of chromatin may impose an additional level of regulation over classical epigenetic marks.},

Investigation of chromosome folding in mutants confirms roles for RSC, ``gene looping'' factor Ssu72, Mediator, H3K56 acetyltransferase Rtt109, and the N-terminal tail of H4 in folding of the yeast genome. This approach provides detailed structural maps of a eukaryotic genome, and our findings provide insights into the machinery underlying chromosome compaction.},

  abstract = {In higher eukaryotes, many genes are regulated by enhancers that are 104\textendash 106~base pairs (bp) away from the promoter. Enhancers contain transcription-factor-binding sites (which are typically around 7\textendash 22~bp), and physical contact between the promoters and enhancers is thought to be required to modulate gene expression. Although chromatin architecture has been mapped extensively at resolutions of 1~kilobase and above; it has not been possible to define physical contacts at the scale of the proteins that determine gene expression. Here we define these interactions in detail using a chromosome conformation capture method (Micro-Capture-C) that enables the physical contacts between different classes of regulatory elements to be determined at base-pair resolution. We find that highly punctate contacts occur between enhancers, promoters and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) sites and we show that transcription factors have an important role in the maintenance of the contacts between enhancers and promoters. Our data show that interactions between CTCF sites are increased when active promoters and enhancers are located within the intervening chromatin. This supports a model in which chromatin loop extrusion1 is dependent on cohesin loading at active promoters and enhancers, which explains the formation of tissue-specific chromatin domains without changes in CTCF binding.},

A virulence strategy used by the intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila is to manipulate host cellular processes using bacterial proteins that are delivered into the cytosolic compartment of the host cell by a specialized secretion system called Dot/Icm. The proteins delivered by the Dot/Icm system target host factors that play evolutionarily conserved roles in controlling membrane transport in eukaryotic cells, which enables L. pneumophila to create an endoplasmic reticulum-like vacuole that supports intracellular replication in both protozoan and mammalian host cells. This review focuses on intracellular trafficking of L. pneumophila and describes how bacterial proteins contribute to modulation of host processes required for survival within host cells.},

  abstract = {Background: Recent data from genome-wide chromosome conformation capture analysis indicate that the human genome is divided into conserved megabase-sized self-interacting regions called topological domains. These topological domains form the regulatory backbone of the genome and are separated by regulatory boundary elements or barriers. Copy-number variations can potentially alter the topological domain architecture by deleting or duplicating the barriers and thereby allowing enhancers from neighboring domains to ectopically activate genes causing misexpression and disease, a mutational mechanism that has recently been termed enhancer adoption. Results: We use the Human Phenotype Ontology database to relate the phenotypes of 922 deletion cases recorded in the DECIPHER database to monogenic diseases associated with genes in or adjacent to the deletions. We identify combinations of tissue-specific enhancers and genes adjacent to the deletion and associated with phenotypes in the corresponding tissue, whereby the phenotype matched that observed in the deletion. We compare this computationally with a gene-dosage pathomechanism that attempts to explain the deletion phenotype based on haploinsufficiency of genes located within the deletions. Up to 11.8\% of the deletions could be best explained by enhancer adoption or a combination of enhancer adoption and gene-dosage effects. Conclusions: Our results suggest that enhancer adoption caused by deletions of regulatory boundaries may contribute to a substantial minority of copy-number variation phenotypes and should thus be taken into account in their medical interpretation.},

While disruption of chromatin domains and domain boundaries can lead to misexpression of developmental genes, acute depletion of regulators of genome organization has a relatively small effect on gene expression. It is therefore uncertain whether gene expression and chromatin state drive chromatin organization or whether changes in chromatin organization facilitate cell-type-specific activation of gene expression. Here, using the dorsoventral patterning of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo as a model system, we provide evidence for the independence of chromatin organization and dorsoventral gene expression. We define tissue-specific enhancers and link them to expression patterns using single-cell RNA-seq. Surprisingly, despite tissue-specific chromatin states and gene expression, chromatin organization is largely maintained across tissues. Our results indicate that tissue-specific chromatin conformation is not necessary for tissue-specific gene expression but rather acts as a scaffold facilitating gene expression when enhancers become active.},

Establishment of the replication compartment requires a specialized translocation system that transports a large cadre of protein substrates across the vacuolar membrane. These substrates regulate vesicle traffic and survival pathways in the host cell.

We addressed this issue in an aphid species where both sexual and obligate asexual lineages coexist in natural populations. These sexual and asexual lineages may occasionally interbreed because some asexual lineages maintain a residual production of males potentially able to mate with the females produced by sexual lineages. Hence, this species is an ideal model to study the genetic basis of the loss of sexual reproduction with quantitative genetic and population genomic approaches. Our analysis of the co-segregation of ,300 molecular markers and reproductive phenotype in experimental crosses pinpointed an X-linked region controlling obligate asexuality, this state of character being recessive. A population genetic analysis (.400-marker genome scan) on wild sexual and asexual genotypes from geographically distant populations under divergent selection for reproductive strategies detected a strong signature of divergent selection in the genomic region identified by the experimental crosses. These population genetic data confirm the implication of the candidate region in the control of reproductive mode in wild populations originating from 700 km apart. Patterns of genetic differentiation along chromosomes suggest bidirectional gene flow between populations with distinct reproductive modes, supporting contagious asexuality as a prevailing route to permanent parthenogenesis in pea aphids. This genetic system provides new insights into the mechanisms of coexistence of sexual and asexual aphid lineages.},

The CTCF-CTCF loops we identified form a chromosomal framework of insulated neighborhoods, which in turn form topologically associating domains (TADs) that are largely preserved during the transition between the naive and primed states. Regulatory changes in enhancer-promoter interactions occur within insulated neighborhoods during cell state transition. The CTCF anchor regions we identified are conserved across species, influence gene expression, and are a frequent site of mutations in cancer cells, underscoring their functional importance in cellular regulation.

It is thought that these strand asymmetries arise as a result of mutational biases and selective constraints, particularly for energy efficiency. Analysis of compositional skews in a diverse set of bacteria provides a comparative context in which mutational and selective environmental constraints can be studied. These analyses typically require finished and well-annotated genomic sequences. Results: We present three novel metrics for examining genome composition skews; all three metrics can be computed for unfinished or partially-annotated genomes. The first two metrics, (dot-skew and cross-skew) depend on sequence and gene annotation of a single genome, while the third metric (residual skew) highlights unusual genomes by subtracting a GC content-based model of a library of genome sequences. We applied these metrics to 7738 available bacterial genomes, including partial drafts, and identified outlier species. A phylogenetically diverse set of these outliers (i.e., Borrelia, Ehrlichia, Kinetoplastibacterium, and Phytoplasma) display similar skew patterns but share lifestyle characteristics, such as intracellularity and biosynthetic dependence on their hosts. Conclusions: Our novel metrics appear to reflect the effects of biosynthetic constraints and adaptations to life within one or more hosts on genome composition. We provide results for each analyzed genome, software and interactive visualizations at http://db.systemsbiology.net/gestalt/skew\_metrics.},

  abstract = {A great diversity of plants and fungi engage in mycorrhizal associations. In natural habitats, and in an ecologically meaningful time span, these associations have evolved to improve the fitness of both plant and fungal symbionts. In systems managed by humans, mycorrhizal associations often improve plant productivity, but this is not always the case. Mycorrhizal fungi might be considered to be parasitic on plants when net cost of the symbiosis exceeds net benefits. Parasitism can be developmentally induced, environmentally induced, or possibly genotypically induced. Morphological, phenological, and physiological characteristics of the symbionts influence the functioning of mycorrhizas at an individual scale. Biotic and abiotic factors at the rhizosphere, community, and ecosystem scales further mediate mycorrhizal functioning. Despite the complexity of mycorrhizal associations, it might be possible to construct predictive models of mycorrhizal functioning. These models will need to incorporate variables and parameters that account for differences in plant responses to, and control of, mycorrhizal fungi, and differences in fungal effects on, and responses to, the plant. Developing and testing quantitative models of mycorrhizal functioning in the real world requires creative experimental manipulations and measurements. This work will be facilitated by recent advances in molecular and biochemical techniques. A greater understanding of how mycorrhizas function in complex natural systems is a prerequisite to managing them in agriculture, forestry, and restoration.},

  abstract = {The maintenance of sexual reproduction by natural selection poses a paradox for evolutionary biology. Assuming ``all else equal,'' a sexual lineage producing both males and females has a slower intrinsic growth rate than a clonal lineage producing only females. Hence, clones should rapidly outcompete their sexual counterparts, unless there are ecological or mutation-clearing advantages to sex, or unless the all-else-equal assumption is incorrect. Here we examined the crucial all-else-equal assumption using a lake population of freshwater snails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) in which both diploid sexual and triploid parthenogenetic individuals coexist. We contrasted the variation in life-history traits between sexual and clonal forms to the variation in life histories among habitats and sampling locations. We also conducted a laboratory experiment in which sexual snails competed with a single clone for 1 yr. We found that size at maturity varied among habitats within the lake, but this difference was not attributable to reproductive mode. There were also no differences among clonal and sexual individuals with respect either to brood size or to the frequency of developmental errors in brooded embryos. Finally, in the laboratory competition experiment, the growth rate of sexual individuals was significantly lower than the growth rate of snails from a single clone. Taken together, these results suggest that the allelse-equal assumption is correct, and that a cost of males exists in natural sexual populations of these snails.},

We infected murine ligated intestinal loops with invasive and noninvasive Salmonella typhimurium strains for 30, 60, 120, and 180 min and examined the infected tissue by transmission electron microscopy. Within 30 min, we found that invasive S. typhimurium exclusively entered M cells found within the follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) of the Peyer's patches. Initially, interactions between invasive bacteria and enterocytes adjacent to the M cells were not found. Invasion of M cells was associated with the ability of the bacteria to invade tissue culture cells. S. typhimurium mutants, which were noninvasive for tissue culture cells, could not be found in ligated loops associated with M cells or enterocytes after incubations of 30, 60, 120, or 180 min. At 60 min, internalized invasive S. typhimurium were cytotoxic for the M cells. Destruction of an M cell formed a gap in the FAE which allowed organisms to invade enterocytes adjacent to the dead cell. Later in the infection process (120 and 180 min), the presence of bacteria beneath the FAE correlated with changes in the cytoarchitecture of the lymphoid follicle. In addition, replicating Salmonella began to enter both the apical and basolateral surfaces of enterocytes adjacent to infected M cells.},

Through an enormous experimental effort1\textendash 4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence\textemdash the structure prediction component of the `protein folding problem'8\textemdash has been an important open research problem for more than 50~years9. Despite recent progress10\textendash 14, existing methods fall far~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

Although the MyD88 pathway is important for the expression of both primary and secondary response genes, we show that the recruitment of NF-{$\kappa$}B, RNA polymerase, and the TATA-binding protein is MyD88-dependent only at secondary response genes. This selective dependence correlates with the fact that MyD88 is required for nucleosome remodeling and histone H3K4 trimethylation at secondary response promoters, whereas rapidly induced primary response promoters are assembled into poised MyD88-independent chromatin structures. At a subset of secondary response promoters, I{$\kappa$}B{$\zeta$} was identified as a selective regulator of H3K4 trimethylation and preinitiation complex assembly after nucleosome remodeling. These mechanistic distinctions advance our understanding of the diverse molecular cascades that underlie the differential regulation of pro-inflammatory genes.},

  abstract = {Phylogeography is the study of evolutionary history among populations in a species associated with geographic genetic variation. This paper examines the phylogeography of three African gorilla subspecies based on two types of DNA sequence data. One type is HV1, the first hyper-variable region in the control region of the mitochondrial genome. The other type is nuclear mitochondrial DNA (Numt DNA), which results from the introgression of a copy of HV1 from the mitochondrial genome into the nuclear genome. Numt and HV1 sequences evolve independently when in different organelles, but they share a common evolutionary history at the same locus in the mitochondrial genome prior to introgression. This study estimates the evolutionary history of gorilla populations in terms of population divergence times and effective population sizes. Also, this study estimates the number of introgression events. The estimates are obtained in a Bayesian framework using novel Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The method is based on a hybrid coalescent process that combines separate coalescent processes for HV1 and Numt sequences along with a transfer model for introgression events within a single population tree. This Bayesian method for the analysis of Numt and HV1 sequences is the first approach specifically designed to model the evolutionary history of homologous multi-locus sequences within a population tree framework. The data analysis reveals highly discordant estimates of the divergence time between eastern and western gorilla populations for HV1 and Numt sequences. The discordant east-west split times are evidence of male-mediated gene flow between east and west long after female gorillas stopped this migration. In addition, the analysis estimates multiple independent introgression events.},

  abstract = {The primary signal of sex determination in the honeybee, the complementary sex determiner (csd) gene, evolved from a gene duplication event from an ancestral copy of the fem gene. Recently, other paralogs of the fem gene have been identified in several ant and bumblebee genomes. This discovery and the close phylogenetic relationship of the paralogous gene sequences led to the hypothesis of a single ancestry of the csd genetic system of complementary sex determination in the Hymenopteran insects, in which the fem and csd gene copies evolved as a unit in concert with the mutual transfers of sequences (concerted evolution). Here, we show that the paralogous gene copies evolved repeatedly through independent gene duplication events in the honeybee, bumblebee, and ant lineage. We detected no sequence tracts that would indicate a DNA transfer between the fem and the fem1/csd genes between different ant and bee species. Instead, we found tracts of duplication events in other genomic locations, suggesting that gene duplication was a frequent event in the evolution of these genes. These and other evidences suggest that the fem1/csd gene originated repeatedly through gene duplications in the bumblebee, honeybee, and ant lineages in the last 100 million years. Signatures of concerted evolution were not detectable, implicating that the gene tree based on neutral synonymous sites represents the phylogenetic relationships and origins of the fem and fem1/csd genes. Our results further imply that the fem1 and csd gene in bumblebees, honeybees, and ants are not orthologs, because they originated independently from the fem gene. Hence, the widely shared and conserved complementary sex determination mechanism in Hymenopteran insects is controlled by different genes and molecular processes. These findings highlight the limits of comparative genomics and emphasize the requirement to study gene functions in different species and major hymenopteran lineages.},

Studying each modification in five human cell lines including the ENCODE Consortium common cell lines GM06990 (lymphoblastoid) and HeLa-S3, as well as K562, HFL-1, and MOLT4, we identified clear patterns of histone modification profiles with respect to genomic features. H3K4me3, H3K4me2, and H3ac modifications are tightly associated with the transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of genes, while H3K4me1 and H4ac have more widespread distributions. TSSs reveal characteristic patterns of both types of modification present and the position relative to TSSs. These patterns differ between active and inactive genes and in particular the state of H3K4me3 and H3ac modifications is highly predictive of gene activity. Away from TSSs, modification sites are enriched in H3K4me1 and relatively depleted in H3K4me3 and H3ac. Comparison between cell lines identified differences in the histone modification profiles associated with transcriptional differences between the cell lines.

This revealed a highly dynamic transcriptional landscape, where major transcriptional shifts are conserved among chlamydial symbionts and pathogens. Our data served to propose a time-resolved model for type III protein secretion during the developmental cycle, and we provide evidence for a biphasic metabolism of P.~amoebophila during infection, which involves energy parasitism and amino acids as the carbon source during initial stages and a postreplicative switch to endogenous glucose-based ATP production. This fits well with major transcriptional changes in the amoeba host, where upregulation of complex sugar breakdown precedes the P.~amoebophila metabolic switch. The biphasic chlamydial metabolism represents a unique adaptation to exploit eukaryotic host cells, which likely contributed to the evolutionary success of this group of microbes. IMPORTANCE Chlamydiae are known as major bacterial pathogens of humans, causing the ancient disease trachoma, but they are also frequently found in the environment where they infect ubiquitous protists such as amoebae. All known chlamydiae require a eukaryotic host cell to thrive. Using the environmental chlamydia Protochlamydia amoebophila within its natural host, Acanthamoeba castellanii, we investigated gene expression dynamics in vivo and throughout the complete chlamydial developmental cycle for the first time. This allowed us to infer how a major virulence mechanism, the type III secretion system, is regulated and employed, and we show that the physiology of chlamydiae undergoes a complete shift regarding carbon metabolism and energy generation. This study provides comprehensive insights into the infection strategy of chlamydiae and reveals a unique adaptation to life within a eukaryotic host cell.},

Two important questions are whether all lncRNAs are functional and how they could exert a function. Several lncRNAs have been shown to function through their product, but this is not the only possible mode of action. In this review we focus on a role for the process of lncRNA transcription, independent of the lncRNA product, in regulating protein-coding-gene activity in cis. We discuss examples where lncRNA transcription leads to gene silencing or activation, and describe strategies to determine if the lncRNA product or its transcription causes the regulatory effect.},

High throughput sequencing of mutation accumulation lines has provided genome wide spontaneous mutation rates in a dozen model species, but estimates from nonmodel organisms from much of the diversity of life are very limited. Here, we report mutation rates in four haploid marine bacterial-sized photosynthetic eukaryotic algae; Bathycoccus prasinos, Ostreococcus tauri, Ostreococcus mediterraneus, and Micromonas pusilla. The spontaneous mutation rate between species varies from l {$\frac{1}{4}$} 4.4 \^A 10\`A10 to 9.8 \^A 10\`A10 mutations per nucleotide per generation. Within genomes, there is a two-fold increase of the mutation rate in intergenic regions, consistent with an optimization of mismatch and transcription-coupled DNA repair in coding sequences. Additionally, we show that deviation from the equilibrium GC content increases the mutation rate by \$2\% to \$12\% because of a GC bias in coding sequences. More generally, the difference between the observed and equilibrium GC content of genomes explains some of the inter-specific variation in mutation rates.},

In addition, Micro-C provides a detailed map of nucleosome positions and localizes contact domain boundaries with nucleosomal precision. Compared to Hi-C, Micro-C exhibits an order of magnitude greater dynamic range, allowing the identification of {$\sim$}20,000 additional loops in each cell type.

In this study, we compare nine measures of tissue specificity. Most methods were established for ESTs and microarrays, and several were later adapted to RNA-seq.

These cells respond to stimulation in a fast and stimulus-specific manner by utilizing complex cascaded activation by lineage-determining and signal-dependent transcription factors. The complexity of the functional response is determined by interactions between triggered transcription factors and depends on the microenvironment and interdependent signalling cascades. Dysregulation of macrophage phenotypes is a major driver of various diseases such as atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, exposure of monocytes, which are macrophage precursor cells, to certain stimuli can lead to a hypo-inflammatory tolerized phenotype or a hyper-inflammatory trained phenotype in a macrophage. In atherosclerosis, macrophages and monocytes are exposed to inflammatory cytokines, oxidized lipids, cholesterol crystals and other factors. All these stimuli induce not only a specific transcriptional response but also interact extensively, leading to transcriptional and epigenetic heterogeneity of macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques. Targeting the epigenetic landscape of plaque macrophages can be a powerful therapeutic tool to modulate pro-atherogenic phenotypes and reduce the rate of plaque formation. In this Review, we discuss the emerging role of transcription factors and epigenetic remodelling in macrophages in the context of atherosclerosis and inflammation, and provide a comprehensive overview of epigenetic enzymes and transcription factors that are involved in macrophage activation.},

Macrophages harboring the L. pneumophila sdhA mutant showed increased nuclear degradation, mitochondrial disruption, membrane permeability, and caspase activation, indicating a role for SdhA in preventing host cell death.

Multiple competing technologies have been developed to improve the quality and robustness of genome assemblies during the past decade.

We applied the 2 up-to-date platforms to a single rice individual and then compared the 2 assemblies to investigate the advantages and limitations of each.The results showed that ONT ultralong reads delivered higher contiguity, producing a total of 18 contigs of which 10 were assembled into a single chromosome compared to 394 contigs and 3 chromosome-level contigs for the PacBio assembly. The ONT ultralong reads also prevented assembly errors caused by long repetitive regions, for which we observed a total of 44 genes of false redundancies and 10 genes of false losses in the PacBio assembly, leading to over- or underestimation of the gene families in those long repetitive regions. We also noted that the PacBio HiFi reads generated assemblies with considerably fewer errors at the level of single nucleotides and small insertions and deletions than those of the ONT assembly, which generated an average 1.06 errors per kb and finally engendered 1,475 incorrect gene annotations via altered or truncated protein predictions.It shows that both PacBio HiFi reads and ONT ultralong reads had their own merits. Further genome reference constructions could leverage both techniques to lessen the impact of assembly errors and subsequent annotation mistakes rooted in each.},

However, not all regulatory elements are functionally methylation-dependent (MD). Here, we report a method, mSTARR-seq, that assesses the causal effects of DNA methylation on regulatory activity at hundreds of thousands of fragments (millions of CpG sites) simultaneously. Using mSTARR-seq, we identify thousands of MD regulatory elements in the human genome. MD activity is partially predictable using sequence and chromatin state information, and distinct transcription factors are associated with higher activity in unmethylated versus methylated DNA. Further, pioneer TFs linked to higher activity in the methylated state appear to drive demethylation of experimentally methylated sites. MD regulatory elements also predict methylation-gene expression relationships across individuals, where they are 1.6x enriched among sites with strong negative correlations. mSTARR-seq thus provides a map of MD regulatory activity in the human genome and facilitates interpretation of differential methylation studies.},

The real challenge, especially in the post-genome era, usually comes not from acquiring data, but from subsequent activities such as data processing, analysis, knowledge generation and gaining insight into the research question of interest. The approach of inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) has been flourishing for many years, and new methods from mathematics, information science, engineering and social sciences have been applied. We review different kinds of computational methods biologists use to infer networks of varying levels of accuracy and complexity. The primary concern of biologists is how to translate the inferred network into hypotheses that can be tested with real-life experiments. Taking the biologists' viewpoint, we scrutinized several methods for predicting GRNs in mammalian cells, and more importantly show how the power of different knowledge databases of different types can be used to identify modules and subnetworks, thereby reducing complexity and facilitating the generation of testable hypotheses.},

Le et al. (p. 731, published online 24 October) analyzed the structure of the circular chromosome in the prokaryote Caulobacter crescentus by using chromosome conformation capture and deep-sequencing. Highly self-interacting regions (chromosomal interaction domains, or CIDs) were observed\textemdash similar to the topologically associated domains previously seen in eukaryotes. Supercoiling helped to establish CIDs, and CID boundaries were defined by highly expressed genes. CIDs appeared to be established during or shortly after DNA replication, and could potentially facilitate chromosomal segregation by preventing newly replicated chromosomes from becoming entangled. Chromosomes must be highly compacted and organized within cells, but how this is achieved in vivo remains poorly understood. We report the use of chromosome conformation capture coupled with deep sequencing (Hi-C) to map the structure of bacterial chromosomes. Analysis of Hi-C data and polymer modeling indicates that the Caulobacter crescentus chromosome consists of multiple, largely independent spatial domains that are probably composed of supercoiled plectonemes arrayed into a bottle brush\textendash like fiber. These domains are stable throughout the cell cycle and are reestablished concomitantly with DNA replication. We provide evidence that domain boundaries are established by highly expressed genes and the formation of plectoneme-free regions, whereas the histone-like protein HU and SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) promote short-range compaction and the colinearity of chromosomal arms, respectively. Collectively, our results reveal general principles for the organization and structure of chromosomes in vivo. A bacterial chromosome is organized into self-interacting regions delimited by highly expressed genes.

  abstract = {During infection with gram-negative bacteria, exposure of immune cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the bacterial cell membrane induces a rapid cytokine response which is essential for the activation of host defenses against the invading pathogens. Administration of LPS to mice induces a state of hyporesponsiveness, or tolerance, characterized by reduced cytokine production upon subsequent LPS challenge. In the model of experimental Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection of mice, we assessed the question of whether complete LPS tolerance induced by repetitive doses of LPS interfered with cytokine production and host defense against gram-negative bacteria. Although production of various cytokines in response to serovar Typhimurium was attenuated by LPS pretreatment, LPS-tolerant mice showed improved antibacterial activity, evidenced by a prolongation of survival and a continuously lower bacterial load. We attribute this protective effect to three independent mechanisms. (i) Peritoneal accumulation of leukocytes in the course of LPS pretreatment accounted for enhanced defense against serovar Typhimurium during the first 6 h of infection but not for decreased bacterial load in late-stage infection. (ii) LPS-tolerant mice had an increased capacity to recruit neutrophilic granulocytes during infection. (iii) LPS-tolerant mice showed threefold-increased Kupffer cell numbers, enhanced phagocytic activity of the liver, and strongly improved clearance of blood-borne serovar Typhimurium. These results demonstrate that despite attenuated cytokine response, acquired LPS tolerance is associated with enhanced resistance to infections by gram-negative bacteria and that this effect is mainly mediated by improved effector functions of the innate immune system.},

An ongoing challenge is to uncover the means by which this information is encoded and executed, and thereby also advance our understanding of fundamental biological processes such as development, differentiation and disease.High-throughput methods for in vitro characterization of transcription factor (TF) sequence preferences and for in vivo genome-wide measurements of TF binding improved our understanding of fundamental 'building blocks' of regulatory sequences \textemdash{} namely, TF binding sites (TFBSs). However, these also revealed a pronounced gap between predictions based on the in vitro-derived motifs and the binding patterns observed in cells.Different states of regulatory proteins (such as TFs) in different in vivo conditions or cell types, including the formation of complexes and interaction with cofactors, can result in differential sequence preferences. Accounting for these preferences can help to bridge the gap between in vitro characterization of binding specificity and binding profiles obtained in vivo.TFBSs appear in a range of combinations and organizations within regulatory sequences. The extent to and the manner by which the expression outcome depends on properties of the composition and arrangement of these regulatory architectures differ. For some regulatory sequences, functional dependencies (for example, on the number of TFBSs or the relative distance between these sites) can be characterized, which provides hints into the mechanisms involved (for example, TF cooperativity).The sequence context in which TFBSs are embedded can have important effects on TF binding and the expression outcome. These include effects of TFBS-flanking base pairs, which may be mediated by DNA shape, and effects related to GC content, as may be mediated by nucleosome occupancy.A surge of new methods that couple the classic reporter assay with high-throughput sequencing provide efficient means for quantitatively examining the ability of many thousands of different sequences \textemdash{} both derived from native genomic sequences and systematically designed \textemdash{} to drive gene expression. A challenge for future research is to improve our mechanistic and predictive understanding of these data sets, as well as their relationship to the endogenous activity of promoters and enhancers.An improved understanding of various properties of regulatory sequences and their functional implications can facilitate a better interpretation of personal genomes.

This observation raises the question of how the genome is packaged into chromatin to allow start sites to be recognized by the regulatory machinery at the same time as transcription initiation, but not elongation, is blocked in the 25\% of intragenic DNA. We developed a chromatin scanning technique called ChAP, coupling the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay with arbitrarily primed PCR, which allows for the rapid and unbiased comparison of histone modification patterns within the eukaryotic nucleus. Methylated lysine 4 (K4) and acetylated K9/14 of histone H3 were both highly localized to the 5{${'}$} regions of transcriptionally active human genes but were greatly decreased downstream of the start sites. Our results suggest that the large transcribed regions of human genes are maintained in a deacetylated conformation in regions read by elongating polymerase. Common models depicting widespread histone acetylation and K4 methylation throughout the transcribed unit do not therefore apply to the majority of human genes.},

Outside of ter, the condensin MukBEF and the ubiquitous nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) HU promote DNA contacts in the megabase range. Within ter, the MatP protein prevents MukBEF activity, and contacts are restricted to \$280 kb, creating a domain with distinct structural properties.

Results We used chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing to analyze the rice genome-wide changes to H3K4me1/H3K4me2/H3K4me3 following the loss of an H3K4-specific methyltransferase, SDG701. The knockdown of SDG701 resulted in a global decrease in H3K4me2/H3K4me3 levels throughout the rice genome. An RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that many genes related to diverse developmental processes were misregulated in the SDG701 knockdown mutant. In rice, H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 are positively correlated with gene transcription; however, surprisingly, the H3K4me2 level was negatively associated with gene transcription levels. Furthermore, the H3K4me3 level at the TSS region decreased significantly in the genes that exhibited down-regulated expression in the SDG701 knockdown mutant. In contrast, the genes with up-regulated expression in the mutant were associated with a considerable decrease in H3K4me2 levels over the gene body region. Conclusion A comparison of the genome-wide distributions of H3K4me2 in eukaryotes indicated that the H3K4me2 level is not correlated with the gene transcription level in yeast, but is positively and negatively correlated with gene expression in animals and plants, respectively. Our results uncovered H3K4me2 as a novel repressive mark in plants.

  abstract = {Legionella pneumophila, the etiological agent of Legionnaires' disease, replicates intracellularly in protozoan and human hosts. Successful colonization and replication of this pathogen in host cells requires the Dot/Icm type IVB secretion system, which translocates approximately 300 effector proteins into the host cell to modulate various cellular processes. In this study, we identified RavK as a Dot/Icm substrate that targets the host cytoskeleton and reduces actin filament abundance in mammalian cells upon ectopic expression. RavK harbors an H95EXXH99 motif associated with diverse metalloproteases, which is essential for the inhibition of yeast growth and for the induction of cell rounding in HEK293T cells. We demonstrate that the actin protein itself is the cellular target of RavK and that this effector cleaves actin at a site between residues Thr351 and Phe352. Importantly, RavK-mediated actin cleavage also occurs during L. pneumophila infection. Cleavage by RavK abolishes the ability of actin to form polymers. Furthermore, an F352A mutation renders actin resistant to RavK-mediated cleavage; expression of the mutant in mammalian cells suppresses the cell rounding phenotype caused by RavK, further establishing that actin is the physiological substrate of RavK. Thus, L. pneumophila exploits components of the host cytoskeleton by multiple effectors with distinct mechanisms, highlighting the importance of modulating cellular processes governed by the actin cytoskeleton in the intracellular life cycle of this pathogen.},

  abstract = {The complete assembly of each human chromosome is essential for understanding human biology and evolution1,2. Here we use complementary long-read sequencing technologies to complete the linear assembly of human chromosome 8. Our assembly resolves the sequence of five previously long-standing gaps, including a 2.08-Mb centromeric {$\alpha$}-satellite array, a 644-kb copy number polymorphism in the {$\beta$}-defensin gene~cluster that is important for disease risk, and an 863-kb variable number tandem repeat at chromosome 8q21.2 that can function as a neocentromere. We show that the centromeric {$\alpha$}-satellite array is generally methylated except for a 73-kb hypomethylated region of diverse higher-order {$\alpha$}-satellites enriched with CENP-A nucleosomes, consistent with the location of the kinetochore. In addition, we confirm the overall organization and methylation pattern of the centromere in a diploid human genome. Using a dual long-read sequencing approach, we complete high-quality draft assemblies of the orthologous centromere from chromosome 8 in chimpanzee, orangutan and macaque to reconstruct its evolutionary history. Comparative and phylogenetic analyses show that the higher-order {$\alpha$}-satellite structure evolved in the great ape ancestor with a layered symmetry, in which more ancient higher-order repeats locate peripherally to monomeric {$\alpha$}-satellites. We estimate that the mutation rate of centromeric satellite DNA is accelerated by more than 2.2-fold compared to the unique portions~of the genome, and this acceleration extends into the flanking sequence.},

It targets different host cell types showing different intracellular lifestyles. S. Typhimurium colonizes different intracellular niches and is able to either actively divide at various rates or remain dormant to persist. A comprehensive tool to determine these distinct S. Typhimurium lifestyles remains lacking. Here we developed a novel fluorescent reporter, Salmonella INtracellular Analyzer (SINA), compatible for fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry in single-bacterium level quantification. This identified a S. Typhimurium subpopulation in infected epithelial cells that exhibits a unique phenotype in comparison to the previously documented vacuolar or cytosolic S. Typhimurium. This subpopulation entered a dormant state in a vesicular compartment distinct from the conventional Salmonella-containing vacuoles (SCV) as well as the previously reported niche of dormant S. Typhimurium in macrophages. The dormant S. Typhimurium inside enterocytes were viable and expressed Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 (SPI-2) virulence factors at later time points. We found that the formation of these dormant S. Typhimurium is not triggered by the loss of SPI-2 effector secretion but it is regulated by (p)ppGpp-mediated stringent response through RelA and SpoT. We predict that intraepithelial dormant S. Typhimurium represents an important pathogen niche and provides an alternative strategy for S. Typhimurium pathogenicity and its persistence.},

Hymenopterans are well suited owing to the diverse sex determination mechanisms, including different types of Complementary Sex Determination (CSD) and maternal control sex determination. We investigated different types of CSD in four species within the braconid wasp genus Asobara that exhibit diverse life-history traits. Nine to thirteen generations of inbreeding were monitored for diploid male production, brood size, offspring sex ratio, and pupal mortality as indicators for CSD. In addition, simulation models were developed to compare these observations to predicted patterns for multilocus CSD with up to ten loci. The inbreeding regime did not result in diploid male production, decreased brood sizes, substantially increased offspring sex ratios nor in increased pupal mortality. The simulations further allowed us to reject CSD with up to ten loci, which is a strong refutation of the multilocus CSD model. We discuss how the absence of CSD can be reconciled with the variation in life-history traits among Asobara species, and the ramifications for the phylogenetic distribution of sex determination mechanisms in the Hymenoptera.},

Release of inhibitory cytokines and alterations in intracellular signaling pathways may be involved in the development of LPS tolerance. Although a number of molecules have been implicated, a detailed picture of the molecular changes in LPS tolerance is still missing. We have used a genome-wide gene expression analysis approach to (i) define which fraction of LPS target genes are subject to tolerance induction and (ii) identify genes that are expressed at high levels in tolerant macrophages. Our data show that in LPS-tolerant macrophages the vast majority of LPS-induced gene expression is abrogated. The extent of tolerance induction varies for individual genes, and a small subset of genes appears to be exempted. Compared to other negative control mechanisms of macrophages, e.g., IL-10induced deactivation, LPS tolerance inhibits a much wider range of transcriptional targets. Some previously described negative regulators of TLR signaling (e.g. IRAK-M) were confirmed as expressed at higher levels in LPS-tolerant macrophages. In addition, we discuss other potential players in LPS tolerance identified in this group of genes.},

More recently cohesin was found to be associated with transcriptional insulators, elements that are associated with the organization of chromatin into regulatory domains. The human major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) locuscontains ten intergenic elements, termed MHC-II insulators, which bind the transcriptional insulator protein CCCTC transcription factor (CTCF). MHC-II insulators interact with each other forming a base architecture of discrete loops and potential regulatory domains. When MHC-II genes are expressed, their proximal promoter regulatory regions reorganize to the foci established by the interacting MHC-II insulators. MHC-II insulators also bind cohesin, but the functional role of cohesin in regulating this system is not known. Here we show that the binding of cohesin to MHC-II insulators occurred irrespective of MHC-II expression but was required for optimal expression of the HLA-DR and HLA-DQ genes. In a DNA dependent manner, cohesin subunits interacted with CTCF and the MHC-II specific transcription factors RFX and CIITA. Intriguingly, cohesin subunits were important for DNA looping interactions between the HLA-DRA promoter region and a 5' MHC-II insulator but were not required for interactions between the MHC-II insulators themselves. This latter observation introduces cohesin as a regulator of MHC-II expression by initiating or stabilizing MHC-II promoter regulatory element interactions with the MHC-II insulator elements; events which are required for maximal MHC-II transcription.},

Here, we combine super-resolution microscopies and chromosome-capture technologies to unravel the higher-order organization of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome and its dynamic rearrangements during the cell cycle. We decipher the fine 3D architecture of the origin domain, revealing folding motifs regulated by condensin-like complexes. This organization, along with global folding throughout the genome, is present before replication, disrupted by active DNA replication, and re-established thereafter. Single-cell analysis revealed a strict correspondence between sub-cellular localization of origin domains and their condensation state. Our results suggest that the precise 3D folding pattern of the origin domain plays a role in the regulation of replication initiation, chromosome organization, and DNA segregation.},

  abstract = {Genomic analyses of microbial populations in their natural environment remain limited by the difficulty to assemble full genomes of individual species. Consequently, the chromosome organization of microorganisms has been investigated in a few model species, but the extent to which the features described can be generalized to other taxa remains unknown. Using controlled mixes of bacterial and yeast species, we developed meta3C, a metagenomic chromosome conformation capture approach that allows characterizing individual genomes and their average organization within a mix of organisms. Not only can meta3C be applied to species already sequenced, but a single meta3C library can be used for assembling, scaffolding and characterizing the tridimensional organization of unknown genomes. By applying meta3C to a semi-complex environmental sample, we confirmed its promising potential. Overall, this first meta3C study highlights the remarkable diversity of microorganisms chromosome organization, while providing an elegant and integrated approach to metagenomic analysis.           ,              Microbial communities play vital roles in the environment and sustain animal and plant life. Marine microbes are part of the ocean's food chain; soil microbes support the turnover of major nutrients and facilitate plant growth; and the microbial communities residing in the human gut support digestion and the immune system, among other roles. These communities are very complex systems, often containing 1000s of different species engaged in co-dependent relationships, and are therefore very difficult to study.             The entire DNA sequence of an organism constitutes its genome, and much of this genetic information is stored in large structures called chromosomes. Examining the genome of a species can provide important clues about its lifestyle and how it evolved. To do this, DNA is extracted from cells and is then usually cut into smaller fragments, amplified, and sequenced. The small stretches of sequence obtained, called reads, are finally assembled, yielding ideally the complete genome of the organism under study.             Metagenomics attempts to interpret the combined genome of all the different species in a microbial community and has been instrumental in deciphering how the different species interact with each other. Metagenomics involves sequencing stretches of the community's DNA and matching these pieces to individual species to ultimately assemble whole genomes. While this may be a relatively straightforward task for communities that contain only a handful of members, the metagenomes derived from complex microbial communities are huge, fragmented, and incomplete. This often makes it very difficult or even nearly impossible to match the inferred DNA stretches to individual species.             A method called chromosome conformation capture (or `3C' for short) can reveal the physical contacts between different regions of a chromosome and between the different chromosomes of a cell. How often each of these chromosomal contacts occurs provides a kind of physical signature to each genome and each individual chromosome within it.             Marbouty et al. took advantage of these interactions to develop a technique that combines metagenomics and chromosome conformation capture\textemdash called meta3C\textemdash that can analyze the DNA of many different species mixed together. Testing meta3C on artificial mixtures of a few species of yeast or bacteria showed that meta3C can separate the genomes of the different species without any prior knowledge of the composition of the mix. In a single experiment, meta3C can identify individual chromosomes, match each of them to its species of origin, and reveal the three-dimensional structure of each genome in the mix. Further tests showed that meta3C can also interpret more complex communities where the number and types of the species present are not known.             Meta3C holds great promise for understanding how microbial communities work and how the genomes of the species within a community are organized. However, further developments of the technique will be required to investigate communities as diverse as those present in most natural environments.},

  abstract = {Background: Mammalian transcriptomes contain thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Some lncRNAs originate from intragenic enhancers which, when active, behave as alternative promoters producing transcripts that are processed using the canonical signals of their host gene. We have followed up this observation by analyzing intergenic lncRNAs to determine the extent to which they might also originate from intergenic enhancers. Results: We integrated high-resolution maps of transcriptional initiation and transcription to annotate a conservative set of intergenic lncRNAs expressed in mouse erythroblasts. We subclassified intergenic lncRNAs according to chromatin status at transcriptional initiation regions, defined by relative levels of histone H3K4 mono- and trimethylation. These transcripts are almost evenly divided between those arising from enhancer-associated (elncRNA) or promoter-associated (plncRNA) elements. These two classes of 5{${'}$} capped and polyadenylated RNA transcripts are indistinguishable with regard to their length, number of exons or transcriptional orientation relative to their closest neighboring gene. Nevertheless, elncRNAs are more tissue-restricted, less highly expressed and less well conserved during evolution. Of considerable interest, we found that expression of elncRNAs, but not plncRNAs, is associated with enhanced expression of neighboring protein-coding genes during erythropoiesis. Conclusions: We have determined globally the sites of initiation of intergenic lncRNAs in erythroid cells, allowing us to distinguish two similarly abundant classes of transcripts. Different correlations between the levels of elncRNAs, plncRNAs and expression of neighboring genes suggest that functional lncRNAs from the two classes may play contrasting roles in regulating the transcript abundance of local or distal loci.},

In this paper, we found that interferon-{$\gamma$} (IFN-{$\gamma$}) -activated macrophages infected with Salmonella typhimurum secreted peptides able to load empty MHC Kb molecules on co-cultured TAP-2-deficient RMA-S cells, added as targets for peptide loading. The increase in class I Kb on the RMA-S cells, resulting from the macrophage-derived peptides, exhibited a comparable stability as the direct addition of an exogenous Kb-binding peptide (OVA257\textendash 264) to the RMA-S cells. In both cases, the Kb complexes were stable for at least 3 hr after separating the RMA-S cells from the macrophages. The endosomal inhibitors, leupeptin and ammonium chloride, did not inhibit the release of peptides and the increase in Kb staining on the RMA-S cells in the co-culture systems. Brefeldin A also had no effect. P815 cells previously co-cultured with Salmonella-infected macrophages became targets for cytotoxic T lymphocytes isolated from Salmonella-infected BALB/c mice. Taken together, our data suggest that IFN-{$\gamma$}-activated macrophages process exogenous antigens in an intracellular compartment where serine proteases generate peptides released to the external environment for loading empty MHC class I molecules at the cell surface. This TAP-independent mechanism for the MHC class I presentation may be involved in priming cytotoxic T lymphocytes against intracellular pathogens in vivo.},

Recent studies showed that certain unicellular eukaryotes contain fragments of NCLDV DNA integrated in their genome, when surprisingly many of these organisms were not previously shown to be infected by NCLDVs. These findings prompted us to search the genome of Acanthamoeba castellanii strain Neff (Neff), one of the most prolific hosts in the discovery of giant NCLDVs, for possible DNA inserts of viral origin. We report the identification of 267 markers of lateral gene transfer with viruses, approximately half of which are clustered in Neff genome regions of viral origins, transcriptionally inactive or exhibit nucleotide-composition signatures suggestive of a foreign origin. The integrated viral genes had diverse origin among relatives of viruses that infect Neff, including Mollivirus, Pandoravirus, Marseillevirus, Pithovirus, and Mimivirus. However, phylogenetic analysis suggests the existence of a yet-undiscovered family of amoeba-infecting NCLDV in addition to the five already characterized. The active transcription of some apparently anciently integrated virus-like genes suggests that some viral genes might have been domesticated during the amoeba evolution. These insights confirm that genomic insertion of NCLDV DNA is a common theme in eukaryotes. This gene flow contributed fertilizing the eukaryotic gene repertoire and participated in the occurrence of orphan genes, a long standing issue in genomics. Search for viral inserts in eukaryotic genomes followed by environmental screening of the original viruses should be used to isolate radically new NCLDVs.},

  abstract = {During intestinal disease induced by Salmonella typhimurium transepithelial migration of neutrophils (PMN) rapidly follows attachment of the bacteria to the epithelial apical membrane. Among the events stimulated by these interactions is the release of chemotaxins that guide PMN through the subepithelial matrix and subsequently through the epithelium itself (McCormick, B.A., S.P. Colgan, C. Delp-Archer, S.I. Miller, and J.L. Madara. 1993. J. Cell Biol. 123:895-907). Given the substantial volume flow that normally characterizes matrix compartments underlying transporting epithelia, it is unclear how such transmatrix signaling is sustained. Here we show that when underlying matrices are isolated from biophysically confluent polarized monolayers of the human intestinal epithelial cell line T84, they fail to support substantial transmatrix migration of PMN unless an exogenous chemotactic gradient is imposed. In contrast, such matrices isolated from confluent monolayers apically colonized with S. typhimurium support spontaneous transmatrix migration of PMN. Such chemotactic imprinting of underlying matrices is resistant to volume wash and is paralleled by secretion of the known matrix-binding chemokine IL-8. Chemotactic imprinting of the matrix underlying S. typhimurium-colonized monolayers is dependent on epithelial protein synthesis, is directional implying the existence of a gradient, and is neutralized by antibodies either to IL-8 or to the IL-8 receptor on PMN. An avirulent S. typhimurium strain, PhoPc, which attaches to epithelial cells as efficiently as wild-type S. typhimurium, fails to induce basolateral secretion of IL-8 and likewise fails to imprint matrices. Together, these observations show that the epithelial surface can respond to the presence of a luminal pathogen and subsequently imprint the subepithelial matrix with retained IL-8 gradients sufficient to resist washout effects of the volume flow that normally traverses this compartment. Such data further support the notion that the primary role for basolateral secretion of IL-8 by the intestinal and likely other epithelia is recruitment of PMN through the matrix to the subepithelial space, rather than directing the final movement of PMN across the epithelium.},

  abstract = {Salmonella serotypes which elicit human enteritis cannot be distinguished from those that do not on the basis of their in vitro interactions with eukaryotic cells. We have recently reported that an enteritis-producing strain of Salmonella typhimurium signals intact intestinal epithelium to recruit subepithelial neutrophils to migrate across the epithelial (B. A. McCormick, S. P. Colgan, C. D. Archer, S. I. Miller, and J. L. Madara, J. Cell Biol. 123:895-907, 1993). We now utilize a cell culture model of human intestinal epithelium (with T84 cells) to examine whether such transepithelial signaling to neutrophils by salmonellae is predictive of potential to elicit gastroenteritis. Various Salmonella serotypes, including S. typhimurium, S. enteritidis, S. pullorum, S. arizonae, S. typhi, and S. paratyphi, as well as invasion-defective mutants of S. typhimurium, were studied. Strains or serotypes which elicit diffuse enteritis in humans (defined histologically as transepithelial migration of neutrophils) exhibited transepithelial signaling to neutorphils across epithelial cell monolayers, while those which do not elicit diffuse enteritis in humans did not display transepithelial signaling. In contrast, the ability to enter the apical surface of T84 cells did not differentiate strains or serotypes which induce diffuse enteritis from those which do not. These results strongly suggest that the ability of salmonellae to elicit transepithelial signaling to neutrophils is a key virulence mechanism underlying Salmonella-elicited enteritis.},

They have diminutive gene sets that rival some mitochondria and chloroplasts in terms of gene numbers and lack genes that are considered to be essential in other bacteria. These symbionts have numerous features in common, such as extraordinarily fast protein evolution and a high abundance of chaperones. Together, these features point to highly degenerate genomes that retain only the most essential functions, often including a considerable fraction of genes that serve the hosts. These discoveries have implications for the concept of minimal genomes, the origins of cellular organelles, and studies of symbiosis and host-associated microbiota.},

This book provides a comprehensive overview on the sources, ecology and laboratory diagnosis of legionella. Guidance is provided on risk assessment and risk management of susceptible environments. The necessary measures to prevent, or adequately control, the risk from exposure to legionella bacteria are identified for each identified environment. Outbreaks of legionellosis generally cause a high level of morbidity and mortality in the people affected and as such the suspicion of an outbreak warrants immediate action. The policies and practice for outbreak management and the institutional roles and responsibilities of an outbreak control team are reviewed. This book will be useful to all those concerned with legionella and health, including environmental and public health officers, health care workers, the travel industry, researchers and special interest groups.},

  abstract = {Background Gene-set enrichment analysis is a useful technique to help functionally characterize large gene lists, such as the results of gene expression experiments. This technique finds functionally coherent gene-sets, such as pathways, that are statistically over-represented in a given gene list. Ideally, the number of resulting sets is smaller than the number of genes in the list, thus simplifying interpretation. However, the increasing number and redundancy of gene-sets used by many current enrichment analysis software works against this ideal. Principal Findings To overcome gene-set redundancy and help in the interpretation of large gene lists, we developed ``Enrichment Map'', a network-based visualization method for gene-set enrichment results. Gene-sets are organized in a network, where each set is a node and edges represent gene overlap between sets. Automated network layout groups related gene-sets into network clusters, enabling the user to quickly identify the major enriched functional themes and more easily interpret the enrichment results. Conclusions Enrichment Map is a significant advance in the interpretation of enrichment analysis. Any research project that generates a list of genes can take advantage of this visualization framework. Enrichment Map is implemented as a freely available and user friendly plug-in for the Cytoscape network visualization software (http://baderlab.org/Software/EnrichmentMap/).},

The organism has been associated with septicemia and respiratory tract infections. In our investigation, Burkholderia pickettii (biovar 2) was for the first time isolated from Acanthamoeba sp. (group II), a free living amoeba species recovered from the wet area of a physiotherapy unit. Pathogenic strains of acanthamoebae may cause amoebic\- encephalitis (AE) and keratitis. Light and electron microscopic examinations showed that in a first step, the bacteria were phagocytised by the amoebae. In contrast to Enterobacter cloa\- cae and Escherichia coli that were used as food organisms and digested within food vacuoles, Burkholderia pickettii caused the amoebae to develop large vacuoles filled with completely intact and motile bacteria. 3-5 days after infection, Pseudomonas pickettii had multiplied within the enlarging parasitophorous vacuoles. Ultrastructural changes in the host cells occurred and the amoebae finally underwent rupture or lysis. In cocultivation assays we could not only reinfect the original host amoeba but Acanthamoeba strains from other habitats could successfully be infected with Burkholderia pickettii as well.},

However, no single chromosome has been finished end to end, and hundreds of unresolved gaps persist               1,2               . Here we present a human genome assembly that surpasses the continuity of GRCh38               2               , along with a gapless, telomere-to-telomere assembly of a human chromosome. This was enabled by high-coverage, ultra-long-read nanopore sequencing of the complete hydatidiform mole CHM13 genome, combined with complementary technologies for quality improvement and validation. Focusing our efforts on the human X~chromosome               3               , we reconstructed the centromeric satellite DNA array (approximately 3.1~Mb) and closed the 29 remaining gaps in the current reference, including new sequences from the human pseudoautosomal regions and from cancer-testis ampliconic gene families (CT-X and GAGE). These sequences will be integrated into future human reference genome releases. In addition, the complete chromosome X, combined with the ultra-long nanopore data, allowed us to map methylation patterns across complex tandem repeats and satellite arrays. Our results demonstrate that finishing the entire human genome is now within reach, and the data presented here will facilitate ongoing efforts to complete the other human chromosomes.},

This long-lived intermediate state was introduced in 1988 (Grosberg et al. 1988) and has not been observed in experiments or simulations until recently (Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009). Recent characterization of human chromatin using a novel chromosome conformational capture technique brought the fractal globule into the spotlight as a structural model of human chromosome on the scale of up to 10~Mb (Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009). Here, we present the concept of the fractal globule, comparing it to other states of a polymer and focusing on its properties relevant for the biophysics of chromatin. We then discuss properties of the fractal globule that make it an attractive model for chromatin organization inside a cell. Next, we connect the fractal globule to recent studies that emphasize topological constraints as a primary factor driving formation of chromosomal territories. We discuss how theoretical predictions, made on the basis of the fractal globule model, can be tested experimentally. Finally, we discuss whether fractal globule architecture can be relevant for chromatin packing in other organisms such as yeast and bacteria.},

Unlike allopatric specialized intracellular pathogens, they have not specialized because they infect the amoebae via amoebal attack and present a sympatric lifestyle with species from different phyla. In this review, we compare the genomes from bacteria (Legionella pneumophila, Legionella drancourtii, Candidatus `Protochlamydia amoebophila,' Rickettsia bellii, Candidatus `Amoebophilus asiaticus') and a virus (mimivirus) that multiply naturally in amoebae. The objective is to highlight the genomic traits characterizing these microorganisms and their niche by comparison with other specialized pathogens. The genome of intra-amoebal microorganisms is significantly larger than that of their relatives, contradicting the genome reduction theory mostly accepted for intracellular pathogens. This is probably due to the fact that they are not specialized and therefore maintain their genome size. Moreover, the presence of many horizontally transferred genes and mobilomes in their genomes suggests that these microorganisms acquired genetic material from their neighbors and amoebal host, thus increasing their genome size. Important features involved in gene transfer and pathogenicity were thus acquired. These characteristics suggest that amoebae constitute a gene melting pot, allowing diverse microorganisms to evolve by the same pathway characterized by gene acquisition, and then either adapt to the intra-amoebal lifestyle or create new pathogens.},

  abstract = {When confronted by disparate environments, microbes routinely alter their physiology to tolerate or exploit local conditions. But some circumstances require more drastic remodelling of the bacterial cell, as sporulation by the Bacillus and Streptomyces species of soil bacteria vividly illustrates. Cellular differentiation is also crucial for pathogens, the challenge for which is to colonize one host, then be transmitted to the next. Using the Gram-negative Legionella pneumophila as a model intracellular pathogen, we describe how biogenesis of the replication vacuole is determined by the developmental state of the bacterium. Subsequently, when replicating bacteria have exhausted the nutrient supply, the pathogens couple their conversion to stationary phase physiology with expression of traits that promote transmission to a new host. The cellular differentiation of L. pneumophila is co-ordinated by a regulatory circuit that integrates several elements that are broadly conserved in the microbial world. The alarmone (p)ppGpp promotes transcription directed by the alternative sigma factors RpoS, FliA and, probably, RpoN, and also post-transcriptional control mediated by a two-component regulatory system, LetA/S (GacA/S), and an mRNA-binding protein, CsrA (RsmA). By applying knowledge of microbial differentiation in combination with tools to screen the complete genomes of pathogens, experiments can be designed to identify two distinct classes of virulence traits: factors that promote replication and those dedicated to transmission.},

Among the key players, Hoxd genes are coordinately regulated in developing digits, where they help organize growth and patterns. We identified the distal regulatory sites associated with these genes by probing the three-dimensional architecture of this regulatory unit in developing limbs. This approach, combined with in~vivo deletions of distinct regulatory regions, revealed that the active part of the gene cluster contacts several enhancer-like sequences. These elements are dispersed throughout the nearby gene desert, and each contributes either quantitatively or qualitatively to Hox gene transcription in presumptive digits. We propose that this genetic system, which we call a ``regulatory archipelago,'' provides an inherent flexibility that may partly underlie the diversity in number and morphology of digits across tetrapods, as well as their resilience to drastic variations.

However, they display high error rates, currently capped around 10\%. Self-correction is thus regularly used in long reads analysis projects. We introduce CONSENT, a new self-correction method that relies both on multiple sequence alignment and local de Bruijn graphs. To ensure scalability, multiple sequence alignment computation benefits from a new and efficient segmentation strategy, allowing a massive speedup. CONSENT compares well to the state-of-the-art, and performs better on real Oxford Nanopore data. Specifically, CONSENT is the only method that efficiently scales to ultra-long reads, and allows to process a full human dataset, containing reads reaching up to 1.5 Mbp, in 10 days. Moreover, our experiments show that error correction with CONSENT improves the quality of Flye assemblies. Additionally, CONSENT implements a polishing feature, allowing to correct raw assemblies. Our experiments show that CONSENT is 2-38x times faster than other polishing tools, while providing comparable results.

  abstract = {Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, is widely distributed throughout natural and artificial water systems and can replicate in macrophages and amoebae. Amoebae are the natural hosts of L. pneumophila, whereas macrophages are incidentally infected. The life cycle of L. pneumophila comprises a replicative phase within the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) and a transmissive phase during which bacterial cells become motile and are released via killing of the host. Although the host death mechanisms induced by L. pneumophila have been studied, the expression patterns of related L. pneumophila genes have not been reported. The present study compared the expression patterns of host cell death-associated genes in L. pneumophila grown in the human monocytic cell line THP-1 and Acanthamoeba castellanii. Notably, when L. pneumophila was grown in THP-1, expression of the gene flaA, which is involved in the induction of pyroptosis, was downregulated during the course of infection. In contrast, sdhA associated indirectly with host death, was upregulated. Expression of the genes vipD and sidF, which are involved in the induction and suppression of apoptosis, changed by less than 2-fold. Notably, a lower percentage of pyroptotic cells was observed among infected THP-1 cells relative to uninfected cells, and the latter exhibited stronger expression of caspase-1. A different pattern was observed when L. pneumophila was grown in A. castellanii: flaA and vipD were activated, whereas sdhA and sidF were downregulated during the later stage of replication. The percentage of non-viable (annexin-VC PIC or annexin-VCPI\textexclamdown ) A. castellanii organisms increased with Legionella infection, and the expression of metacaspase-1, which is involved in encystation was upregulated at late infection time. In summary, L. pneumophila can multiply intracellularly in both amoebae and macrophages to induce cell death and secondary infection, and this characteristic is essential for its survival in water and the lungs. The gene expression profiles observed in this study indicated the increased cytotoxicity of L. pneumophila in A. castellanii, suggesting an increased adaptation of Legionella to this host.},

Here, by using genome-wide binding profiling, we show extensive occupancy of transcription factors of myogenesis (MyoD and Myogenin) at extragenic enhancer regions coinciding with RNA synthesis (i.e., eRNA). In particular, multiple regions were transcribed to eRNA within the regulatory region of MYOD1, including previously characterized distal regulatory regions (DRR) and core enhancer (CE). While CERNA enhanced RNA polymerase II (Pol II) occupancy and transcription at MYOD1, DRRRNA acted to activate the downstream myogenic genes. The deployment of transcriptional machinery to appropriate loci is contingent on chromatin accessibility, a rate-limiting step preceding Pol II assembly. By nuclease sensitivity assay, we found that eRNAs regulate genomic access of the transcriptional complex to defined regulatory regions. In conclusion, our data suggest that eRNAs contribute to establishing a cell-type-specific transcriptional circuitry by directing chromatin-remodeling events.},

By analogy with the genetic code, we posit that the concept of code can only be used if the corresponding adaptor can clearly be identified. An adaptor is here defined as an intermediary physical entity mediating the correspondence between codewords and objects in a gratuitous and evolvable way. In the context of the gene regulatory code, the encoded objects are the gene expression levels, while the concentrations of specific transcription factors in the cell nucleus provide the codewords. The notion of code is meaningful in the absence of direct physicochemical relationships between the objects and the codewords, when the mediation by an adaptor is required. We propose that a plausible adaptor for this code is the gene domain, that is, the genome segment delimited by topological insulators and comprising the gene and its enhancer regulatory sequences. We review recent evidences, based on genome-wide chromosome conformation capture experiments, showing that preferential contact domains found in metazoan genomes are the physical traces of gene domains. Accordingly, genome 3D folding plays a direct role in shaping the developmental gene regulatory code.},

  abstract = {Salmonella has evolved an intimate functional interface with its host. Central to this interface is a battery of bacterial proteins delivered into host cells via a specialized organelle termed the type III secretion system. A subset of these bacterial proteins stimulates cellular responses by activating the Rho family GTPases Cdc42 and Rac. Stimulation of these responses leads to actin cytoskeleton reorganization and the activation of cellular transcription factors that result in bacterial uptake and proinflammatory cytokine production. Remarkably, the cellular responses stimulated by Salmonella are quickly reversed by another bacterial protein, SptP, which exerts its function as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Cdc42 and Rac. In addition to its GAP activity located within its amino-terminus, the carboxy-terminal domain of SptP possesses potent tyrosine phosphatase activity. We show here that the tyrosine phosphatase activity of SptP is involved in reversing the MAP kinase activation that results from Salmonella infection. We also demonstrate an important role for tyrosine kinases, including ACK, in the cellular responses induced by Salmonella. We also found that a potential target for the tyrosine phosphatase activity of SptP is the intermediate filament protein vimentin, which is recruited to the membrane ruffles stimulated by Salmonella.},

In this study, the Ctcf gene was specifically deleted in myeloid cells by making use of the transgenic Cre-LoxP system.

Ctcf-deficient mice exhibited significantly reduced expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II in the liver. Ctcf-deficient macrophages demonstrated a normal surface phenotype and phagocytosis capacity. Upon Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation, they produced normal levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12 and IL-6, but manifested a strongly impaired capacity to produce tumor-necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-10, as well as to express the IL-10 family members IL-19, IL-20 and IL-24.

In this study, we performed systematic 4C analysis using three cell lines containing differently positioned neocentromeres to identify neocentromere-associated regions at the 3D level. This analysis reveals that these neocentromeres commonly associate with specific heterochromatin-rich regions, which were distantly located from neocentromeres. In addition, we demonstrate that centromeric chromatin adopts a compact structure, and centromere clustering also occurs in vertebrate interphase nuclei. Interestingly, the occurrence of centromere\textendash heterochromatin associations depend on CENP-H, but not CENP-C.

  abstract = {Heteroallelic and homo- or hemiallelic Complementary sex determiner (Csd) proteins determine sexual fate in the honeybee (Apis mellifera) by controlling the alternative splicing of the downstream gene fem (feminizer). Thus far, we have little understanding of how heteroallelic Csd proteins mediate the splicing of female fem messenger RNAs (mRNAs) or how Fem proteins direct the splicing of honeybee dsx (Am-dsx) pre-mRNAs. Here, we report that Am-tra2, which is an ortholog of Drosophila melanogaster tra2, is an essential component of female splicing of the fem and Am-dsx transcripts in the honeybee. The Am-tra2 transcripts are alternatively (but non-sex-specifically) spliced, and they are translated into six protein isoforms that all share the basic RNA-binding domain/RS (arginine/serine) domain structure. Knockdown studies showed that the Am-tra2 gene is required to splice fem mRNAs into the productive female and nonproductive male forms. We suggest that the Am-Tra2 proteins are essential regulators of fem pre-mRNA splicing that, together with heteroallelic Csd proteins and/or Fem proteins, implement the female pathway. In males, the Am-Tra2 proteins may enhance the switch of fem transcripts into the nonproductive male form when heteroallelic Csd proteins are absent. This dual function of Am-Tra2 proteins possibly enhances and stabilizes the binary decision process of male/female splicing. Our knockdown studies also imply that the Am-Tra2 protein is an essential regulator for Am-dsx female splice regulation, suggesting an ancestral role in holometabolous insects. We also provide evidence that the Am-tra2 gene has an essential function in honeybee embryogenesis that is unrelated to sex determination.},

Using the auxin-inducible degron system in mouse embryonic stem cells, we show that CTCF is absolutely and dose-dependently required for looping between CTCF target sites and insulation of topologically associating domains (TADs). Restoring CTCF reinstates proper architecture on altered chromosomes, indicating a powerful instructive function for CTCF in chromatin folding. CTCF remains essential for TAD organization in non-dividing cells. Surprisingly, active and inactive genome compartments remain properly segregated upon CTCF depletion, revealing that compartmentalization of mammalian chromosomes emerges independently of proper insulation of TADs. Furthermore, our data support that CTCF mediates transcriptional insulator function through enhancer blocking but not as a direct barrier to heterochromatin spreading. Beyond defining the functions of CTCF in chromosome folding, these results provide new fundamental insights into the rules governing mammalian genome organization.},

  abstract = {Plastids, the photosynthetic organelles, originated {$>$}1 billion y ago via the endosymbiosis of a cyanobacterium. The resulting proliferation of primary producers fundamentally changed global ecology. Endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT) from the intracellular cyanobacterium to the nucleus is widely recognized as a critical factor in the evolution of photosynthetic eukaryotes. The contribution of horizontal gene transfers (HGTs) from other bacteria to plastid establishment remains more controversial. A novel perspective on this issue is provided by the amoeba               Paulinella chromatophora               , which contains photosynthetic organelles (chromatophores) that are only 60\textendash 200 million years old. Chromatophore genome reduction entailed the loss of many biosynthetic pathways including those for numerous amino acids and cofactors. How the host cell compensates for these losses remains unknown, because the presence of bacteria in all available               P. chromatophora               cultures excluded elucidation of the full metabolic capacity and occurrence of HGT in this species. Here we generated a high-quality transcriptome and draft genome assembly from the first bacteria-free               P. chromatophora               culture to deduce rules that govern organelle integration into cellular metabolism. Our analyses revealed that nuclear and chromatophore gene inventories provide highly complementary functions. At least 229 nuclear genes were acquired via HGT from various bacteria, of which only 25\% putatively arose through EGT from the chromatophore genome. Many HGT-derived bacterial genes encode proteins that fill gaps in critical chromatophore pathways/processes. Our results demonstrate a dominant role for HGT in compensating for organelle genome reduction and suggest that phagotrophy may be a major driver of HGT.},

L. pneumophila is mainly found associated with protozoa, which serve as protection from hostile environments and as replication niche. If inhaled within aerosols, L. pneumophila is also able to infect and replicate in human alveolar macrophages, eventually causing the Legionnaires' disease. The transition between intracellular and extracellular environments triggers a differentiation program in which metabolic as well as morphogenetic changes occur. We here describe the current knowledge on how the different developmental states of this bacterium are regulated, with a particular emphasis on the stringent response activated during the transition from the replicative phase to the infectious phase and the metabolic features going in hand. We propose that the cellular differentiation of this intracellular pathogen is closely associated to key metabolic changes in the bacterium and the host cell, which together have a crucial role in the regulation of L. pneumophila virulence.},

Enhancer activity is associated with the production of tissue-specific noncoding RNAs, yet the existence of such transcripts during cardiac development has not been established. Using an integrated genomic approach, we demonstrate that fetal cardiac enhancers generate long noncoding RNAs (IncRNAs) during cardiac differentiation and morphogenesis. Enhancer expression correlates with the emergence of active enhancer chromatin states, the initiation of RNA polymerase II at enhancer loci and expression of target genes. Orthologous human sequences are also transcribed in fetal human hearts and cardiac progenitor cells. Through a systematic bioinformatic analysis, we identified and characterized, for the first time, a catalog of IncRNAs that are expressed during embryonic stem cell differentiation into cardiomyocytes and associated with active cardiac enhancer sequences. RNA-sequencing demonstrates that many of these transcripts are polyadenylated, multi-exonic long noncoding RNAs. Moreover, knockdown of two enhancerassociated IncRNAs resulted in the specific downregulation of their predicted target genes. Interestingly, the reactivation of the fetal gene program, a hallmark of the stress response in the adult heart, is accompanied by increased expression of fetal cardiac enhancer transcripts. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that the activity of cardiac enhancers and expression of their target genes are associated with the production of enhancer-derived IncRNAs.},

To detect ARB from both human and environmental samples, co-culture with amoebae has been demonstrated as an efficient tool. However, using this procedure, mostly water from cooling towers and hospital water supplies have been investigated as the possible reservoir of ARB. In the present study, we studied ARB population in 77 environmental water samples including rivers, fountains, lakes and domestic wells in the south of France. As a result, a total of 244 isolates corresponding to 89 different species of ARB, but not Legionella spp., were identified. Ability to grow within and/or to be lytic for amoebae was revealed for the first time for several human pathogens. Six isolates are likely to be the members of a new or uncharacterized genus/ species. An anaerobic bacterium, Clostridium frigidicarnis was demonstrated to be lytic for amoebae. This preliminary work demonstrates that the water environment in the vicinity of humans is a reservoir of ARB, including well-known pathogens for which amoebae and/or water was not recognized earlier as a possible reservoir.},

  abstract = {The contribution of pre-mRNA processing mechanisms to the regulation of immune responses remains poorly studied despite emerging examples of their role as regulators of immune defenses. We sought to investigate the role of mRNA processing in the cellular responses of human macrophages to live bacterial infections. Here, we used mRNA sequencing to quantify gene expression and isoform abundances in primary macrophages from 60 individuals, before and after infection with Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium. In response to both bacteria we identified thousands of genes that significantly change isoform usage in response to infection, characterized by an overall increase in isoform diversity after infection. In response to both bacteria, we found global shifts towards (i) the inclusion of cassette exons and (ii) shorter 3' UTRs, with near-universal shifts towards usage of more upstream polyadenylation sites. Using complementary data collected in non-human primates, we show that these features are evolutionarily conserved among primates. Following infection, we identify candidate RNA processing factors whose expression is associated with individual-specific variation in isoform abundance. Finally, by profiling microRNA levels, we show that 3' UTRs with reduced abundance after infection are significantly enriched for target sites for particular miRNAs. These results suggest that the pervasive usage of shorter 3' UTRs is a mechanism for particular genes to evade repression by immune-activated miRNAs. Collectively, our results suggest that dynamic changes in RNA processing may play key roles in the regulation of innate immune responses.},

  abstract = {The medfly Ceratitis capitata contains a gene (Cctra) with structural and functional homology to the Drosophila melanogaster sex-determining gene transformer (tra). Similar to tra in Drosophila, Cctra is regulated by alternative splicing such that only females can encode a full-length protein. In contrast to Drosophila, however, where tra is a subordinate target of Sex-lethal (Sxl), Cctra seems to initiate an autoregulatory mechanism in XX embryos that provides continuous tra female-specific function and act as a cellular memory maintaining the female pathway. Indeed, a transient interference with Cctra expression in XX embryos by RNAi treatment can cause complete sexual transformation of both germline and soma in adult flies, resulting in a fertile male XX phenotype. The male pathway seems to result when Cctra autoregulation is prevented and instead splice variants with truncated open reading frames are produced. We propose that this repression is achieved by the Y-linked male-determining factor (M).},

LPS, also known as endotoxin, is a potent inducer of inflammation and M1 polarization. LPS can also generate an effect in MNCs known as endotoxin tolerance, defined as the reduced capacity of a cell to respond to LPS activation after an initial exposure to this stimulus. Using systems biology approaches in PBMCs, monocytes, and monocyte-derived macrophages involving microarrays and advanced bioinformatic analysis, we determined that gene responses during endotoxin tolerance were similar to those found during M2 polarization, featuring gene and protein expression critical for the development of key M2 MNC functions, including reduced production of proinflammatory mediators, expression of genes involved in phagocytosis, as well as tissue remodeling. Moreover, expression of different metallothionein gene isoforms, known for their role in the control of oxidative stress and in immunomodulation, were also found to be consistently upregulated during endotoxin tolerance. These results demonstrate that after an initial inflammatory stimulus, human MNCs undergo an M2 polarization probably to control hyperinflammation and heal the affected tissue.},

  abstract = {The ability to efficiently and accurately determine genotypes is a keystone technology in modern genetics, crucial to studies ranging from clinical diagnostics, to genotype-phenotype association, to reconstruction of ancestry and the detection of selection. To date, high capacity, low cost genotyping has been largely achieved via ``SNP chip'' microarray-based platforms which require substantial prior knowledge of both genome sequence and variability, and once designed are suitable only for those targeted variable nucleotide sites. This method introduces substantial ascertainment bias and inherently precludes detection of rare or population-specific variants, a major source of information for both population history and genotypephenotype association. Recent developments in reduced-representation genome sequencing experiments on massively parallel sequencers (commonly referred to as RAD-tag or RADseq) have brought direct sequencing to the problem of population genotyping, but increased cost and procedural and analytical complexity have limited their widespread adoption. Here, we describe a complete laboratory protocol, including a custom combinatorial indexing method, and accompanying software tools to facilitate genotyping across large numbers (hundreds or more) of individuals for a range of markers (hundreds to hundreds of thousands). Our method requires no prior genomic knowledge and achieves per-site and per-individual costs below that of current SNP chip technology, while requiring similar hands-on time investment, comparable amounts of input DNA, and downstream analysis times on the order of hours. Finally, we provide empirical results from the application of this method to both genotyping in a laboratory cross and in wild populations. Because of its flexibility, this modified RADseq approach promises to be applicable to a diversity of biological questions in a wide range of organisms.},

  abstract = {Background: Morphological divergence often increases with phylogenetic distance, thus making morphology taxonomically informative. However, transitions to asexual reproduction may complicate this relationship because asexual lineages capture and freeze parts of the phenotypic variation of the sexual populations from which they derive. Parasitoid wasps belonging to the genus Lysiphlebus Foerster (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae) are composed of over 20 species that exploit over a hundred species of aphid hosts, including many important agricultural pests. Within Lysiphlebus, two genetically and morphologically well-defined species groups are recognised: the ``fabarum'' and the ``testaceipes'' groups. Yet within each group, sexual as well as asexual lineages occur, and in L. fabarum different morphs of unknown origin and status have been recognised. In this study, we selected a broad sample of specimens from the genus Lysiphlebus to explore the relationship between genetic divergence, reproductive mode and morphological variation in wing size and shape (quantified by geometric morphometrics). Results: The analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences revealed a clear separation between the ``testaceipes'' and ``fabarum'' groups of Lysiphlebus, as well as three well-defined phylogenetic lineages within the ``fabarum'' species group and two lineages within the ``testaceipes'' group. Divergence in wing shape was concordant with the deep split between the ``testaceipes'' and ``fabarum'' species groups, but within groups no clear association between genetic divergence and wing shape variation was observed. On the other hand, we found significant and consistent differences in the shape of the wing between sexual and asexual lineages, even when they were closely related. Conclusions: Mapping wing shape data onto an independently derived molecular phylogeny of Lysiphlebus revealed an association between genetic and morphological divergence only for the deepest phylogenetic split. In more recently diverged taxa, much of the variation in wing shape was explained by differences between sexual and asexual lineages, suggesting a mechanistic link between wing shape and reproductive mode in these parasitoid wasps.},

Increases in DNA accessibility correlated with the appearance of activating histone marks at surrounding nucleosomes.

It remains unclear how essential positional information is transmitted through cell division such that a daughter cell recapitulates the spatial genome organization of the parent. Lamina-associated domains (LADs) are regions of repressive heterochromatin positioned at the nuclear periphery that vary by cell type and contribute to cell-specific gene expression and identity. Here we show that histone 3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) is an evolutionarily conserved, specific mark of nuclear peripheral heterochromatin and that it is retained through mitosis. During mitosis, phosphorylation of histone 3 serine 10 temporarily shields the H3K9me2 mark allowing for dissociation of chromatin from the nuclear lamina. Using high-resolution 3D immuno-oligoFISH, we demonstrate that H3K9me2-enriched genomic regions, which are positioned at the nuclear lamina in interphase cells prior to mitosis, re-associate with the forming nuclear lamina before mitotic exit. The H3K9me2 modification of peripheral heterochromatin ensures that positional information is safeguarded through cell division such that individual LADs are re-established at the nuclear periphery in daughter nuclei. Thus, H3K9me2 acts as a 3D architectural mitotic guidepost. Our data establish a mechanism for epigenetic memory and inheritance of spatial organization of the genome.},

Plasticity is a hallmark of mononuclear phagocytes, and in response to environmental signals these cells undergo different forms of polarized activation, the extremes of which are called classic or M1 and alternative or M2. NF-kappaB is a key regulator of inflammation and resolution, and its activation is subject to multiple levels of regulation, including inhibitory, which finely tune macrophage functions. Here we identify the p50 subunit of NF-kappaB as a key regulator of M2-driven inflammatory reactions in vitro and in vivo. p50 NF-kappaB inhibits NF-kappaB-driven, M1-polarizing, IFN-beta production. Accordingly, p50-deficient mice show exacerbated M1-driven inflammation and defective capacity to mount allergy and helminth-driven M2-polarized inflammatory reactions. Thus, NF-kappaB p50 is a key component in the orchestration of M2-driven inflammatory reactions.},

Ankyrin B (AnkB) of L. pneumophila is a non-canonical F-box-containing protein, and is the only known Dot/Icm-translocated effector of L. pneumophila essential for intra-vacuolar proliferation within both macrophages and protozoan hosts. We show that the F-box domain of AnkB and the 9L10P conserved residues are essential for intracellular bacterial proliferation and for rapid acquisition of polyubiquitinated proteins by the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) within macrophages, Dictyostelium discoideum, and Acanthamoeba. Interestingly, translocation of AnkB and recruitment of polyubiquitinated proteins in macrophages and Acanthamoeba is rapidly triggered by extracellular bacteria within 5 min of bacterial attachment. Ectopically expressed AnkB within mammalian cells is localized to the periphery of the cell where it co-localizes with host SKP1 and recruits polyubiquitinated proteins, which results in restoration of intracellular growth to the ankB mutant similar to the parental strain. While an ectopically expressed AnkB-9L10P/AA variant is localized to the cell periphery, it does not recruit polyubiquitinated proteins and fails to trans-rescue the ankB mutant intracellular growth defect. Direct in vivo interaction of AnkB but not the AnkB-9L10P/AA variant with the host SKP1 is demonstrated. Importantly, RNAi-mediated silencing of expression of SKP1 renders the cells non-permissive for intracellular proliferation of L. pneumophila. The role of AnkB in exploitation of the polyubiquitination machinery is essential for intrapulmonary bacterial proliferation in the mouse model of Legionnaires' disease. Therefore, AnkB exhibits a novel molecular and functional mimicry of eukaryotic F-box proteins that exploits conserved polyubiquitination machinery for intracellular proliferation within evolutionarily distant hosts.},

Here, we show that six of the seven sequenced ants have two copies of               tra               . Surprisingly, the two paralogues are always more similar within species than among species. Comparative sequence analyses indicate that this pattern is owing to the ongoing concerted evolution after an ancestral duplication rather than independent duplications in each of the six species. In particular, there was strong support for inter-locus recombination between the paralogues of the ant               Atta cephalotes               . In the five species where the location of paralogues is known, they are adjacent to each other in four cases and separated by only few genes in the fifth case. Because there have been extensive genomic rearrangements in these lineages, this suggests selection acting to conserve their synteny. In three species, we also find a signature of positive selection in one of the paralogues. In three bee species where information is available, the               tra               gene is also duplicated, the copies are adjacent and in at least one species there was recombination between paralogues. These results suggest that concerted evolution plays an adaptive role in the evolution of this gene family.},

Later during infection, they proliferate in vacuoles and form colonies harboring dozens of LF82 bacteria. In the present work, we investigated the mechanism sustaining this phase of growth. We found that intracellular LF82 produced an extrabacterial matrix that acts as a biofilm and controls the formation of LF82 intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) for several days post infection. We revealed the crucial role played by the pathogenicity island encoding the yersiniabactin iron capture system to form IBCs and for optimal LF82 survival.

In this study, we investigate multinuclearity in amoebae. We observe that non-adherent amoebae are giant multinucleate cells compared to adherent ones. The cells solve their multinuclearity by a stretchy cytokinesis process with cytosolic bridge formation when adherence resumes. After initial adhesion to a new substrate, the progeny of the multinucleate cells is more numerous than the sibling cells generated from uninucleate amoebae. Hence, multinucleate amoebae show an advantage for population growth when the number of cells is quantified over time. Multiple nuclei per cell are observed in different amoeba species, and the lack of adhesion induces multinuclearity in diverse protists such as Acanthamoeba castellanii, Vermamoeba vermiformis, Naegleria gruberi and Hartmannella rhysodes. In this study, we observe that agitation induces a cytokinesis delay, which promotes multinuclearity. Hence, we propose the hypothesis that multinuclearity represents a physiological adaptation under non-adherent conditions that can lead to biologically relevant advantages.},

Only more recently has it become clear that many eusocial species also regularly reproduce thelytokously, and here we provide a comprehensive overview. Especially in ants, thelytoky underlies a variety of idiosyncratic life histories with unique evolutionary and ecological consequences. In all eusocial species studied, thelytoky probably has a nuclear genetic basis and the underlying cytological mechanism retains high levels of heterozygosity. This is in striking contrast to many solitary wasps, in which thelytoky is often induced by cytoplasmic bacteria and results in an immediate loss of heterozygosity. These differences are likely related to differences in haplodiploid sex determination mechanisms, which in eusocial species usually require heterozygosity for female development. At the same time, haplodiploidy might account for important preadaptations that can help explain the apparent ease with which Hymenoptera transition between sexual and asexual reproduction.},

However, because of this diversity, the logical organization of the genome with respect to nucleosome remodeling and gene induction has remained obscure. Numerous proinflammatory genes are rapidly induced in macrophages in response to microbial infection. Here, we show that in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages, the catalytic BRG1/BRM subunits of the SWI/SNF class of ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling complexes are consistently required for the activation of secondary response genes and primary response genes induced with delayed kinetics, but not for rapidly induced primary response genes. Surprisingly, a Mi-2beta complex was selectively recruited along with the SWI/SNF complexes to the control regions of secondary response and delayed primary response genes, with the Mi-2beta complex acting antagonistically to limit the induction of these gene classes. SWI/SNF and Mi-2beta complexes influenced cell size in a similarly antagonistic manner. These results provide insight into the differential contributions of nucleosome remodeling complexes to the rapid induction of defined classes of mammalian genes and reveal a robust anti-inflammatory function of Mi-2beta.},

Loss of loop domains does not lead to widespread ectopic gene activation but does affect a significant minority of active genes. In particular, cohesin loss causes superenhancers to co-localize, forming hundreds of links within and across chromosomes and affecting the regulation of nearby genes. We then restore cohesin and monitor the re-formation of each loop. Although reformation rates vary greatly, many megabase-sized loops recovered in under an hour, consistent with a model where loop extrusion is rapid.},

Here, we examine chromosome conformation in embryonic stem cells lacking cohesin and find, as in other cell types, that cohesin is required to create TADs and regulate A/B compartmentalization. However, in the absence of cohesin, we identify a series of long-range chromosomal interactions that persist. These correspond to regions of the genome occupied by the polycomb repressive system and are dependent on PRC1. Importantly, we discover that cohesin counteracts these polycomb-dependent interactions, but not interactions between super-enhancers. This disruptive activity is independent of CTCF and insulation and appears to modulate gene repression by the polycomb system. Therefore, we discover that cohesin disrupts polycomb-dependent chromosome interactions to modulate gene expression in embryonic stem cells.},

Here we discuss genome-scale strategies to discover and characterize lncRNAs. An emerging theme from multiple model systems is that lncRNAs form extensive networks of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes with numerous chromatin regulators, and target these enzymatic activities to appropriate locations in the genome. Consistent with this notion, long noncoding RNAs can function as modular scaffolds to specify higher order organization in RNP complexes and in chromatin states. The importance of these modes of regulation is underscored by the newly recognized roles of long RNAs for proper gene control across all kingdoms of life.},

Here, we demonstrate the promise of ABC for analysis of the large data sets that are now attainable from nonmodel taxa through current genomic sequencing technologies. We develop and test an ABC framework for model selection and parameter estimation, given histories of three-population divergence with admixture. We then explore different sampling regimes to illustrate how sampling more loci, longer loci or more individuals affects the quality of model selection and parameter estimation in this ABC framework. Our results show that inferences improved substantially with increases in the number and/or length of sequenced loci, while less benefit was gained by sampling large numbers of individuals. Optimal sampling strategies given our inferential models included at least 2000 loci, each approximately 2 kb in length, sampled from five diploid individuals per population, although specific strategies are model and question dependent. We tested our ABC approach through simulation-based cross-validations and illustrate its application using previously analysed data from the oak gall wasp, Biorhiza pallida.},

They are distributed in the rhizospheric zone and the surrounding bulk soil; however, they may spread deeper, reaching the vadose zone of groundwater systems, especially where bacterial populations get to high densities.Soil texture is the physical factor controlling the distribution of FLA because it determines the mean bore pore of soil aggregates and other important physical factors. FLA help maintain the high bacterial mineralization rate of organic matter through predation. As attachment onto a surface is necessary for feeding, the quantity of available surfaces is very important for developing this activity. However, the role of protozoa on plant growth promotion is still unclear because they may increase this effect by feeding on both fungi and bacteria.Small FLA are found in soils or sediments, as well as attached to suspended particulate matter in water columns, in the first 30 {$\mu$}m of water surface, or on the bodies of submerged animals and plants. These microorganisms do not distinguish between terrestrial or aquatic environments because they live in the interfaces between them. However, their importance in aquatic systems has been considered as negligible because they are out competed by free swimmers. The water conditions affecting amoebae survival are pH, temperature, concentration of sulfhydric acid and salinity. These factors have a strong influence on the structure of amoebae communities in aquatic environments.FLA are considered cosmopolitan as a group, and they live inside vertebrates, in soils, freshwater, marine waters, and on the aerial parts of plants and animals. These microbes, are spread by wind and water currents. Once in the air, cysts and trophozoites behave like any other suspended particulate matter. Therefore, suspension, transportation, and removal depend on atmospheric dynamics rather than on their own mechanisms. Ultraviolet light and drought are the main causes of losing viability, but much needs to be learned about the effects of air contaminants on amoebal survival. Naked amoebae also live in the phyllosphere as part of phylloplane community, but their importance and participation in this environment remain unknown. Some species belonging to the genera Acanthamoebae, Naegleria, and Balamuthia cause fatal diseases in humans and are carriers of other pathogens such as Legionella pneumophilia. However, FLA communities can be of some utility in sewage treatment works based in soil filters. FLA's predatory activity in the root zone method may be of greater importance than previously thought, because this is their natural or more favorable environment. Research on the feeding behavior of FLA species, their rate of biomass transformation, and growth rate changes in response to environmental stresses are still needed in order to clarify their importance in both sewage system works and agricultural fields, where both bacteria and amoebae are involved.},

Thus, to successfully survive in a host cell, a sophisticated bacterial strategy is the subversion of nuclear processes of the eukaryotic cell. Indeed, the number of bacterial proteins that target host chromatin to remodel the host epigenetic machinery is expanding. Some of the identified bacterial effectors that target the chromatin machinery are `eukaryotic-like' proteins as they mimic eukaryotic histone writers in carrying the same enzymatic activities. The best-studied examples are the SET domain proteins that methylate histones to change the chromatin landscape. In this review, we will discuss SET domain proteins identified in the Legionella, Chlamydia and Bacillus genomes that encode enzymatic activities targeting host histones. Moreover, we discuss their possible origin as having evolved from prokaryotic ancestors or having been acquired from their eukaryotic hosts during their co-evolution.

Pathogens alter host epigenetic control to aid pathogenesis. We find that the intracellular bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila uses a Dot/Icm type IV secreted effector, RomA, to uniquely modify the host chromatin landscape. RomA, a SET domaincontaining methyltransferase, trimethylates K14 of histone H3, a histone mark not previously described in mammals. RomA localizes to the infected cell nucleus where it promotes a burst of H3K14 methylation and consequently decreases H3K14 acetylation, an activating histone mark, to repress host gene expression. ChIP-seq analysis identified 4,870 H3K14 methylated promoter regions, including innate immune genes. Significantly reduced replication of a RomA-deleted strain in host cells was trans-complemented by wild-type, but not by catalytically inactive, RomA. Thus, a secreted L. pneumophila effector targets the host cell nucleus and modifies histones to repress gene expression and promote efficient intracellular replication.},

Results We have extended the analysis of histone modifications to gene deserts, pericentromeres and subtelomeres. Using data from human CD4+ T cells, we have found that each of these non-genic regions has a particular profile of histone modifications that distinguish it from the other non-coding regions. Different methylation states of H4K20, H3K9 and H3K27 were found to be enriched in each region relative to the other regions. These findings indicate that non-genic regions of the genome are variable with respect to histone modification patterns, rather than being monolithic. We furthermore used consensus sequences for unassembled centromeres and telomeres to identify the significant histone modifications in these regions. Finally, we compared the modification patterns in non-genic regions to those at silent genes and genes with higher levels of expression. For all tested methylations with the exception of H3K27me3, the enrichment level of each modification state for silent genes is between that of non-genic regions and expressed genes. For H3K27me3, the highest levels are found in silent genes. Conclusion In addition to the histone modification pattern difference between euchromatin and heterochromatin regions, as is illustrated by the enrichment of H3K9me2/3 in non-genic regions while H3K9me1 is enriched at active genes; the chromatin modifications within non-genic (heterochromatin-like) regions (e.g. subtelomeres, pericentromeres and gene deserts) are also quite different.},

Proteomics revealed the presence of the small GTPase Ran and its effector RanBP1 on purified LCVs. Here we validate that Ran and RanBP1 localize to LCVs and promote intracellular growth of L. pneumophila. Moreover, the L. pneumophila protein LegG1, which contains putative RCC1 Ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domains, accumulates on LCVs in an Icm/Dot-dependent manner. L. pneumophila wild-type bacteria, but not strains lacking LegG1 or a functional Icm/Dot T4SS, activate Ran on LCVs, while purified LegG1 produces active Ran(GTP) in cell lysates. L. pneumophila lacking legG1 is compromised for intracellular growth in macrophages and amoebae, yet is as cytotoxic as the wild-type strain. A downstream effect of LegG1 is to stabilize microtubules, as revealed by conventional and stimulated emission depletion (STED) fluorescence microscopy, subcellular fractionation and Western blot, or by microbial microinjection through the T3SS of a Yersinia strain lacking endogenous effectors. Real-time fluorescence imaging indicates that LCVs harboring wild-type L. pneumophila rapidly move along microtubules, while LCVs harboring {$\Delta$}legG1 mutant bacteria are stalled. Together, our results demonstrate that Ran activation and RanBP1 promote LCV formation, and the Icm/Dot substrate LegG1 functions as a bacterial Ran activator, which localizes to LCVs and promotes microtubule stabilization, LCV motility as well as intracellular replication of L. pneumophila.},

The European river lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis) and brook lamprey (L. planeri) show a low reproductive isolation but have highly distinct life histories, the former being parasitic-anadromous and the latter nonparasitic and freshwater resident. Here we used microsatellite data from six replicated population pairs to reconstruct their history of divergence using an approximate Bayesian computation framework combined with a random forest model. In most population pairs, scenarios of divergence with recent isolation were outcompeted by scenarios proposing ongoing gene flow, namely the Secondary Contact (SC) and Isolation with Migration (IM) models. The estimation of demographic parameters under the SC model indicated a time of secondary contact close to the time of speciation, explaining why SC and IM models could not be discriminated. In case of an ancient secondary contact, the historical signal of divergence is lost and neutral markers converge to the same equilibrium as under the less parameterized model allowing ongoing gene flow. Our results imply that models of secondary contacts should be systematically compared to models of divergence with gene flow; given the difficulty to discriminate among these models, we suggest that genome-wide data are needed to adequately reconstruct divergence history.},

Recent advances in divergence population genetics have reported that speciation in face of gene flow occurred more frequently than theoretically expected, but the approaches used did not account for genome-wide heterogeneity (GWH) in introgression rates. Here, we investigate the impact of GWH on the inference of divergence with gene flow between two cryptic species of the marine model Ciona intestinalis by analyzing polymorphism and divergence patterns in 852 protein-coding sequence loci. These morphologically similar entities are highly diverged molecular-wise, but evidence of hybridization has been reported in both laboratory and field studies. We compare various speciation models and test for GWH under the approximate Bayesian computation framework. Our results demonstrate the presence of significant extents of gene flow resulting from a recent secondary contact after {$>$}3 My of divergence in isolation. The inferred rates of introgression are relatively low, highly variable across loci and mostly unidirectional, which is consistent with the idea that numerous genetic incompatibilities have accumulated over time throughout the genomes of these highly diverged species. A genomic map of the level of gene flow identified two hotspots of introgression, that is, large genome regions of unidirectional introgression. This study clarifies the history and degree of isolation of two cryptic and partially sympatric model species and provides a methodological framework to investigate GWH at various stages of speciation process.},

Architectural proteins insulate compartmental domains by reducing interaction frequencies between neighboring regions in Drosophila, but CTCF loops do not play a distinct role in this organism. In mammals, compartmental domains exist alongside CTCF loop domains to form topological domains. The results suggest that compartmental domains are responsible for domain structure in all eukaryotes, with CTCF playing an important role in domain formation in mammals.},

These effector proteins exert their effects by modulating a variety of host innate immune responses, thereby facilitating bacterial replication and systemic infection. Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (S.typhimurium) is a clinically important pathogen that causes food poisoning and gastroenteritis. The SopB effector protein of S.~typhimurium, encoded by Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPI)-1 T3SS, protects host epithelial cells from infection-induced apoptosis. However, how SopB influences apoptosis induction remains unclear. Here, we investigated the mechanism of SopB action in host cells. We found that SopB inhibits infection-induced apoptosis by attenuating the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria, the crucial organelles for apoptosis initiation. Further investigation revealed that SopB binds to cytosolic tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and forms a trap preventing the mitochondrial recruitment of TRAF6, an essential event for ROS generation within mitochondria. By studying the response of Traf6+/+ and Traf6-/-mouse embryonic fibroblasts to S.~typhimurium infection, we found that TRAF6 promoted apoptosis by increasing ROS accumulation, which led to increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, Bax recruitment to mitochondrial membrane, and release of Cyt c into the cytoplasm. These findings show that SopB suppresses host cell apoptosis by binding to TRAF6 and preventing mitochondrial ROS generation.},

The solutions proposed so far do not account for the hierarchy of structural domains which define chromatin three-dimensional (3D) architecture. Here we introduce a change of perspective based on the definition of multi-scale structural chromatin domains, integrated in a statistical framework to define ETG pairs. In this work (i) we develop a computational and statistical framework to reconstruct a comprehensive map of ETG pairs leveraging functional genomics data; (ii) we demonstrate that the incorporation of chromatin 3D architecture information improves ETG pairing accuracy and (iii) we use multiple experimental datasets to extensively benchmark our method against previous solutions for the genome-wide reconstruction of ETG pairs. This solution will facilitate the annotation and interpretation of sequence variants in distal non-coding regulatory elements. We expect this to be especially helpful in clinically oriented applications of whole genome sequencing in cancer and undiagnosed genetic diseases research.},

Specifically, it is unclear how asexuals evolved from sexuals in this system, to what extent reproductive modes are still connected by genetic exchange, how much the complex is structured by geography or by host-associated differentiation, and whether species designations are valid. Using a combination of population genetic and phylogenetic approaches, we addressed these issues in a comprehensive sample of parasitoid wasps from across Europe. Results: Asexual reproduction predominated in parasitoids of the L. fabarum group, with asexual populations exhibiting high genotypic diversity. Sexual populations were only common in southern France; elsewhere sexual reproduction was restricted to specific aphid hosts. Although reproductive modes were aggregated on the mitochondrial genealogy and significantly differentiated at nuclear microsatellite loci, there was clear evidence for genetic exchange, especially on hosts attacked by sexual and asexual parasitoids. The microsatellite data further revealed that parasitoids collected from certain host aphids were significantly differentiated, yet the mitochondrial sequence variation across the entire L. fabarum group did not exceed 1.32\% and exhibited a very shallow topology. Morphological characters used for delineation of described species were found to be phylogenetically non-conservative. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the sexual-asexual L. fabarum group represents a young complex of lineages with incomplete isolation between reproductive modes. We propose three mechanisms of genetic exchange that may jointly explain the high genotypic diversity observed in asexual parasitoids: (i) the formation of new asexual lineages via `contagious parthenogenesis', (ii) introgression from sexual lineages through matings between sexual males and thelytokous females, and (iii) `cryptic sex' within asexuals, mediated by rare males that thelytokous lines are known to produce spontaneously. The partially strong differentiation among wasps collected from different aphids suggests that host specialization can evolve readily in these parasitoids. Finally, we conclude that in the light of our data, the current taxonomic division of the L. fabarum group into three species cannot be upheld.},

  abstract = {The evolutionary maintenance of sex is one of the big unresolved puzzles in biology [1]. All else being equal, all-female asexual populations should enjoy a two-fold reproductive advantage over sexual relatives consisting of male and female individuals [1]. However, the ``all else being equal'' assumption rarely holds in real organisms because asexuality tends to be confounded with altered genomic constitutions such as hybridization [2] and polyploidization [3] or to be associated with parthenogenesis-inducing microbes [4, 5]. This limits the ability to draw general conclusions from any particular system. Here we describe a new system that permits unbiased comparisons of sexual and asexual reproduction: the parasitic wasp Lysiphlebus fabarum. Crossing experiments demonstrated that asexual reproduction has a simple genetic basis in this species and is consistently inherited as a single-locus recessive trait. We further show that the asexuality-inducing allele exhibits complete linkage to a specific allele at a microsatellite marker: all asexual lines in the field were homozygous for this allele, and the allele cosegregated perfectly with asexual reproduction in our experimental crossings. This novel system of contagious asexuality allows the production of closely related individuals with different reproductive modes, as well as the monitoring of the asexuality-inducing allele in natural and experimental populations.},

The alternative possibility that the chromatin fiber of single chromosomes might be extended throughout the major part of even the whole interphase nucleus has been considered for many years. In the latter case, chromosomes would only exist as discrete chromatin bodies during mitosis but not during interphase. Both possibilities are compatible with Boveri's well established paradigm of chromosome individuality. Here we show that an active human X chromosome contained as the only human chromosome in a Chinese hamster x man hybrid cell line can be visualized both in metaphse plates and in interphase nuclei after in situ hybridization with either 3H- or biotin-labeled human genomic DNA. We demonstrate that this chromosome is organized as a distinct chromatin body throughout interphase. In addition, evidence for the territorial organization of human chromosomes is also presented for another hybrid cell line containing several autosomes and the human X chromosome. These findings are discussed in the context of our present knowledge of the organization and topography of interphase chromosomes. General applications of a strategy aimed at specific staining of individual chromosomes in experimental and clinical cytogenetics are briefly considered.},

Here, we report the most comprehensive survey to date of chromatin organization in human tissues. Through integrative analysis of chromatin contact maps in 21 primary human tissues and cell types, we find topologically associating domains highly conserved in different tissues. We also discover genomic regions that exhibit unusually high levels of local chromatin interactions. These frequently interacting regions (FIREs) are enriched for super-enhancers and are near tissue-specifically expressed genes. They display strong tissue-specificity in local chromatin interactions. Additionally, FIRE formation is partially dependent on CTCF and the Cohesin complex. We further show that FIREs can help annotate the function of non-coding sequence variants.},

It is exported into human host cells during infection and has been previously shown to methylate histone H3 at lysine 14 [Rolando et al. (2013), Cell Host Microbe, 13, 395\textendash 405]. Here, we investigated the substrate specificity of RomA on peptide arrays showing that it mainly recognizes a G-K-X(PA) sequence embedded in a basic amino acid sequence context. Based on the specificity profile, we searched for possible additional RomA substrates in the human proteome and identified 34 novel peptide substrates. For nine of these, the corresponding full-length protein or protein domains could be cloned and purified. Using radioactive and antibody-based methylation assays, we showed that seven of them are methylated by RomA, four of them strongly, one moderately, and two weakly. Mutagenesis confirmed for the seven methylated proteins that methylation occurs at target lysine residues fitting to the specificity profile. Methylation of one novel substrate (AROS) was investigated in HEK293 cells overexpressing RomA and during infection with L. pneumophila. Methylation could be detected in both conditions, confirming that RomA methylates non-histone proteins in human cells. Our data show that the bacterial methyltransferase RomA methylates also human non-histone proteins suggesting a multifaceted role in the infection process.},

An RNA-seq experiment with 48 biological replicates in each of two conditions was performed to answer these questions and provide guidelines for experimental design. With three biological replicates, nine of the 11 tools evaluated found only 20\%\textendash 40\% of the significantly differentially expressed (SDE) genes identified with the full set of 42 clean replicates. This rises to {$>$}85\% for the subset of SDE genes changing in expression by more than fourfold. To achieve {$>$}85\% for all SDE genes regardless of fold change requires more than 20 biological replicates. The same nine tools successfully control their false discovery rate at {$\lessequivlnt$}5\% for all numbers of replicates, while the remaining two tools fail to control their FDR adequately, particularly for low numbers of replicates. For future RNA-seq experiments, these results suggest that at least six biological replicates should be used, rising to at least 12 when it is important to identify SDE genes for all fold changes. If fewer than 12 replicates are used, a superior combination of true positive and false positive performances makes edgeR and DESeq2 the leading tools. For higher replicate numbers, minimizing false positives is more important and DESeq marginally outperforms the other tools.},

Each circle contains two 5.9-kb rDNA transcription units organised as inverted repeats. The regions downstream (3543 bp) and upstream (9216 bp) of the rDNAs contain various families of short tandem repeats. Some of the upstream repeats share extensive sequence homology with the downstream repeats. In addition to the rDNAs themselves, the rDNA circle appears to code for only one other transcript which is 0.7 kb in size as seen in Northern blots. From DNA sequence analysis, no open reading frame could be assigned to the transcript. Extrachromosomal rDNA circles also exist in other E. histolytica strains. Restriction enzyme maps of rDNA circles were constructed from E. histolytica strains 200:NIH, HK-9 and Rahman; and Entamoeba moshkovskii strain Laredo. Striking differences were observed in the organisation of some of them, e.g. the HK-9, Rahman and Laredo Circles contained only one rDNA unit and lacked the 0.7-kb transcript sequence. The short repeat sequences upstream and downstream of rDNAs were present in HK-9 and Rahman but absent in Laredo. Circles with one rDNA unit may be derived from those with two units by homologous recombination at direct repeat sequences located upstream and downstream of the two rDNAs.},

  abstract = {Background: The MHC and KIR loci are clinically relevant regions of the genome. Typing the sequence of these loci has a wide range of applications including organ transplantation, drug discovery, pharmacogenomics and furthering fundamental research in immune genetics. Rapid advances in biochemical and next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have enabled several strategies for precise genotyping and phasing of candidate HLA alleles. Nonetheless, as typing of candidate HLA alleles alone reveals limited aspects of the genetics of MHC region, it is insufficient for the comprehensive utility of the aforementioned applications. For this reason, we believe phasing the entire MHC and KIR locus onto a single locus-spanning haplotype can be a critical improvement for better understanding transplantation biology. Results: Generating long-range ({$>$}1 Mb) phase information is traditionally very challenging. As proximity-ligation based methods of DNA sequencing preserves chromosome-span phase information, we have utilized this principle to demonstrate its utility towards generating full-length phasing of MHC and KIR loci in human samples. We accurately (\textasciitilde 99 \%) reconstruct the complete haplotypes for over 90 \% of sequence variants (coding and non-coding) within these two loci that collectively span 4-megabases. Conclusions: By haplotyping a majority of coding and non-coding alleles at the MHC and KIR loci in a single assay, this method has the potential to assist transplantation matching and facilitate investigation of the genetic basis of human immunity and disease.},

  abstract = {The interactions of numerous regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs) with target mRNAs have been characterized, but how sRNAs can regulate multiple, structurally unrelated mRNAs is less understood. Here we show that Salmonella GcvB sRNA directly acts on seven target mRNAs that commonly encode periplasmic substrate-binding proteins of ABC uptake systems for amino acids and peptides. Alignment of GcvB homologs of distantly related bacteria revealed a conserved G/U-rich element that is strictly required for GcvB target recognition. Analysis of target gene fusion regulation in vivo, and in vitro structure probing and translation assays showed that GcvB represses its target mRNAs by binding to extended C/A-rich regions, which may also serve as translational enhancer elements. In some cases (oppA, dppA), GcvB repression can be explained by masking the ribosome-binding site (RBS) to prevent 30S subunit binding. However, GcvB can also effectively repress translation by binding to target mRNAs at upstream sites, outside the RBS. Specifically, GcvB represses gltI mRNA translation at the C/A-rich target site located at positions -57 to -45 relative to the start codon. Taken together, our study suggests highly conserved regions in sRNAs and mRNA regions distant from Shine-Dalgarno sequences as important elements for the identification of sRNA targets.},

To understand the biology of these genomes, annotation of gene features and other functional elements is essential; however, for most species, only the reference genome is well-annotated.One strategy to annotate new or improved genome assemblies is to map or `lift over' the genes from a previously annotated reference genome. Here, we describe Liftoff, a new genome annotation lift-over tool capable of mapping genes between two assemblies of the same or closely related species. Liftoff aligns genes from a reference genome to a target genome and finds the mapping that maximizes sequence identity while preserving the structure of each exon, transcript and gene. We show that Liftoff can accurately map 99.9\% of genes between two versions of the human reference genome with an average sequence identity \&gt;99.9\%. We also show that Liftoff can map genes across species by successfully lifting over 98.3\% of human protein-coding genes to a chimpanzee genome assembly with 98.2\% sequence identity.Liftoff can be installed via bioconda and PyPI. In addition, the source code for Liftoff is available at https://github.com/agshumate/Liftoff.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

However, sequencing errors in the already short RNA-seq reads complicate bioinformatics analyses, in particular alignment and assembly. Error correction methods have been highly effective for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) reads, but are unsuitable for RNA-seq reads, owing to the variation in gene expression levels and alternative splicing. We developed a k-mer based method, Rcorrector, to correct random sequencing errors in Illumina RNA-seq reads. Rcorrector uses a De Bruijn graph to compactly represent all trusted k-mers in the input reads. Unlike WGS read correctors, which use a global threshold to determine trusted k-mers, Rcorrector computes a local threshold at every position in a read. Rcorrector has an accuracy higher than or comparable to existing methods, including the only other method (SEECER) designed for RNA-seq reads, and is more time and memory efficient. With a 5 GB memory footprint for 100 million reads, it can be run on virtually any desktop or server.

Previous attempts at removing biases from Hi-C data have made use of techniques which normalize individual Hi-C datasets, or, at best, jointly normalize two datasets.Here, we present multiHiCcompare, a cyclic loess regression-based joint normalization technique for removing biases across multiple Hi-C datasets. In contrast to other normalization techniques, it properly handles the Hi-C-specific decay of chromatin interaction frequencies with the increasing distance between interacting regions. multiHiCcompare uses the general linear model framework for comparative analysis of multiple Hi-C datasets, adapted for the Hi-C-specific decay of chromatin interaction frequencies. multiHiCcompare outperforms other methods when detecting a priori known chromatin interaction differences from jointly normalized datasets. Applied to the analysis of auxin-treated versus~untreated experiments, and CTCF depletion experiments, multiHiCcompare was able to recover the expected epigenetic and gene expression signatures of loss of chromatin interactions and reveal novel insights.multiHiCcompare is freely available on GitHub and as a Bioconductor R package https://bioconductor.org/packages/multiHiCcompare.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Stapels et al. found that these cells are not dormant but are actively modulating their environment. Salmonella within their host macrophage niche deployed a specialized type 3 secretory system called SPI-2 to deliver virulence factors, including SteE, into host cells. SteE changed the cytokine profile of the infected macrophages to reprogram them into a noninflammatory and infection-permissive state. Thus, when antibiotics were removed, the Salmonella could reemerge and cause disease. Science, this issue p. 1156 Many bacterial infections are hard to treat and tend to relapse, possibly due to the presence of antibiotic-tolerant persisters. In vitro, persister cells appear to be dormant. After uptake of Salmonella species by macrophages, nongrowing persisters also occur, but their physiological state is poorly understood. In this work, we show that Salmonella persisters arising during macrophage infection maintain a metabolically active state. Persisters reprogram macrophages by means of effectors secreted by the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 type 3 secretion system. These effectors dampened proinflammatory innate immune responses and induced anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization. Such reprogramming allowed nongrowing Salmonella cells to survive for extended periods in their host. Persisters undermining host immune defenses might confer an advantage to the pathogen during relapse once antibiotic pressure is relieved. Antibiotic-tolerant, nongrowing Salmonella persister cells modulate the host cell environment to ensure regrowth upon antibiotic removal.

A high density of commensal microbiota inhabits the intestine and shields from infection (``colonization resistance''). The virulence strategies allowing enteropathogenic bacteria to successfully compete with the microbiota and overcome colonization resistance are poorly understood. Here, we investigated manipulation of the intestinal microbiota by the enteropathogenic bacterium Salmonella enterica subspecies 1 serovar Typhimurium (S. Tm) in a mouse colitis model: we found that inflammatory host responses induced by S. Tm changed microbiota composition and suppressed its growth. In contrast to wild-type S. Tm, an avirulent invGsseD mutant failing to trigger colitis was outcompeted by the microbiota. This competitive defect was reverted if inflammation was provided concomitantly by mixed infection with wild-type S. Tm or in mice (IL10-/-, VILLIN-HACL4-CD8) with inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, inflammation is necessary and sufficient for overcoming colonization resistance. This reveals a new concept in infectious disease: in contrast to current thinking, inflammation is not always detrimental for the pathogen. Triggering the host's immune defence can shift the balance between the protective microbiota and the pathogen in favour of the pathogen.},

Upon aerosol formation via man-made water systems, L. pneumophila can enter the human lung and cause a severe form of pneumonia, called Legionnaires' disease. The pathogenesis of Legionnaires' disease is largely due to the ability of L. pneumophila to invade and grow within macrophages. An important characteristic of the intracellular survival strategy is the replication within the host vacuole that does not fuse with endosomes or lysosomes. In recent times a great number of bacterial virulence factors which affect growth of L. pneumophila in both macrophages and protozoa have been identified. The ongoing Legionella genome project and the use of genetically tractable surrogate hosts are expected to significantly contribute to the understanding of bacterium\textendash host interactions and the regulation of virulence traits during the infection cycle. Since person-to-person transmission of legionellosis has never been observed, the measures for disease prevention have concentrated on eliminating the pathogen from water supplies. In this respect detection and analysis of Legionella in complex environmental consortia become increasingly important. With the availability of new molecular tools this area of applied research has gained new momentum.},

Here we calculate 3D structures of entire mammalian genomes using data from a new chromosome conformation capture procedure that allows us to first image and then process single cells. The technique enables genome folding to be examined at a scale of less than 100\,kb, and chromosome structures to be validated. The structures of individual topological-associated domains and loops vary substantially from cell to cell. By contrast, A and B compartments, lamina-associated domains and active enhancers and promoters are organized in a consistent way on a genome-wide basis in every cell, suggesting that they could drive chromosome and genome folding. By studying genes regulated by pluripotency factor and nucleosome remodelling deacetylase (NuRD), we illustrate how the determination of single-cell genome structure provides a new approach for investigating biological processes.},

The fundamental algorithmic architecture for these tools has remained largely unchanged for about two decades, limiting learning capabilities. Here, we set out to improve the cross-species annotation of genes from DNA sequence alone with the help of deep learning. The goal is to eliminate the dependency on a closely related gene model while also improving the predictive quality in general with a fundamentally new architecture.We present Helixer, a framework for the development and usage of a cross-species deep learning model that improves significantly on performance and generalizability when compared to more traditional methods. We evaluate our approach by building a single vertebrate model for the base-wise annotation of 186 animal genomes and a separate land plant model for 51 plant genomes. Our predictions are shown to be much less sensitive to the length of the genome than those of a current state-of-the-art tool. We also present two novel post-processing techniques that each worked to further strengthen our annotations and show in-depth results of an RNA-Seq based comparison of our predictions. Our method does not yet produce comprehensive gene models but rather outputs base pair wise probabilities.The source code of this work is available at https://github.com/weberlab-hhu/Helixer under the GNU General Public License v3.0.

In contrast, CTCF is required for cell cycle regulation17, embryonic development and formation of various adult cell types18. To uncouple the role of CTCF in cell-state transitions and cell proliferation, we studied the effect of CTCF depletion during the conversion of human leukemic B cells into macrophages with minimal cell division. CTCF depletion disrupts TAD organization but not cell transdifferentiation. In contrast, CTCF depletion in induced macrophages impairs the full-blown upregulation of inflammatory genes after exposure to endotoxin. Our results demonstrate that CTCF-dependent genome topology is not strictly required for a functional cell-fate conversion but facilitates a rapid and efficient response to an external stimulus.},

  abstract = {The cell cycle and the relationship between particular cell cycle phases and the differentiation of trophozoites into cysts were reinvestigated in Acanthamoeba castellanii using flow fluorometric measurements of nuclear DNA content and synthesis, and synchronization of cells by release from the stationary phase. The investigation was performed with cultures growing in non-defined medium (ND cells) showing a high degree of encystation in response to starvation, and with subcultures growing in chemically defined nutrient medium (D cells) exhibiting a very low encystation competence. In both cultures the cell cycle starts with a short S phase taking place simultaneously with cytokinesis, followed by a long G2 phase. A Gi phase seems to be either absent or very short. Synchronization experiments reveal that in ND cells encystation is initiated from a particular position of late G2. The high encystation competence of stationary phase ND cells seems to be due to arrest of cells at this particular cell cycle position. The lack of encystation competence of stationary phase D cells correlates with the loss of accumulation of cells at this particular stage of the cell cycle. This change of the property of cells is related to the growth condition and not to an irreversible loss of encystation competence of D cells.},

  abstract = {Environmental bacteria of the genus Legionella naturally parasitize free-living amoebae. Upon inhalation of bacteria-laden aerosols, the opportunistic pathogens grow intracellularly in alveolar macrophages and can cause a life-threatening pneumonia termed Legionnaires' disease. Intracellular replication in amoebae and macrophages takes place in a unique membrane-bound compartment, the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV). LCV formation requires the bacterial Icm/Dot type IV secretion system, which translocates literally hundreds of ``effector'' proteins into host cells, where they modulate crucial cellular processes for the pathogen's benefit. The mechanism of LCV formation appears to be evolutionarily conserved, and therefore, amoebae are not only ecologically significant niches for Legionella spp., but also useful cellular models for eukaryotic phagocytes. In particular, Acanthamoeba castellanii and Dictyostelium discoideum emerged over the last years as versatile and powerful models. Using genetic, biochemical and cell biological approaches, molecular interactions between amoebae and Legionella pneumophila have recently been investigated in detail with a focus on the role of phosphoinositide lipids, small and large GTPases, autophagy components and the retromer complex, as well as on bacterial effectors targeting these host factors.},

Regulator of chromosome condensation 1 (RCC1) repeat proteins are phylogenetically widespread and implicated in protein-protein interactions, such as the activation of the small GTPase Ran by its cognate guanine nucleotide exchange factor, RCC1. Legionella pneumophila and Coxiella burnetii, the causative agents of Legionnaires' disease and Q fever, respectively, harbour RCC1 repeat coding genes. Legionella pneumophila secretes the RCC1 repeat 'effector' proteins LegG1, PpgA and PieG into eukaryotic host cells, where they promote the activation of the pleiotropic small GTPase Ran, microtubule stabilisation, pathogen vacuole motility and intracellular bacterial growth as well as host cell migration. The RCC1 repeat effectors localise to the pathogen vacuole or the host plasma membrane and target distinct components of the Ran GTPase cycle, including Ran modulators and the small GTPase itself. Coxiella burnetii translocates the RCC1 repeat effector NopA into host cells, where the protein localises to nucleoli. NopA binds to Ran GTPase and promotes the nuclear accumulation of Ran(GTP), thus pertubing the import of the transcription factor NF-{$\kappa$}B and innate immune signalling. Hence, divergent evolution of bacterial RCC1 repeat effectors defines the range of Ran GTPase cycle targets and likely allows fine-tuning of Ran GTPase activation by the pathogens at different cellular sites.},

Typhi infection have been intensively studied, very little is known about the early chromatin modifications occurring in the human gut microenvironment that influence downstream immune responses. To address this gap in knowledge, cells isolated from human terminal ileum exposed ex vivo to the wild-type S. Typhi strain were stained with a 33-metal-labeled antibody panel for mass cytometry analyses of the early chromatin modifications modulated by S. Typhi. We measured the cellular levels of 6 classes of histone modifications, and 1 histone variant in 11 major cell subsets (i.e., B, CD3\,+\,T, CD4\,+\,T, CD8\,+\,T, NK, TCR-{$\gamma\delta$}, Mucosal associated invariant (MAIT), and NKT cells as well as monocytes, macrophages, and epithelial cells). We found that arginine methylation might regulate the early-differentiation of effector-memory CD4+\,T-cells following exposure to S. Typhi. We also found S. Typhi-induced post-translational modifications in histone methylation and acetylation associated with epithelial cells, NKT, MAIT, TCR-{$\gamma\delta$}, Monocytes, and CD8\,+\,T-cells that are related to both gene activation and silencing.},

  abstract = {Budding yeast, like other eukaryotes, carries its genetic information on chromosomes that are sequestered from other cellular constituents by a double membrane, which forms the nucleus. An elaborate molecular machinery forms large pores that span the double membrane and regulate the traffic of macromolecules into and out of the nucleus. In multicellular eukaryotes, an intermediate filament meshwork formed of lamin proteins bridges from pore to pore and helps the nucleus reform after mitosis. Yeast, however, lacks lamins, and the nuclear envelope is not disrupted during yeast mitosis. The mitotic spindle nucleates from the nucleoplasmic face of the spindle pole body, which is embedded in the nuclear envelope. Surprisingly, the kinetochores remain attached to short microtubules throughout interphase, influencing the position of centromeres in the interphase nucleus, and telomeres are found clustered in foci at the nuclear periphery. In addition to this chromosomal organization, the yeast nucleus is functionally compartmentalized to allow efficient gene expression, repression, RNA processing, genomic replication, and repair. The formation of functional subcompartments is achieved in the nucleus without intranuclear membranes and depends instead on sequence elements, protein\textendash protein interactions, specific anchorage sites at the nuclear envelope or at pores, and long-range contacts between specific chromosomal loci, such as telomeres. Here we review the spatial organization of the budding yeast nucleus, the proteins involved in forming nuclear subcompartments, and evidence suggesting that the spatial organization of the nucleus is important for nuclear function.},

Although accuracy and efficiency are common goals in many modeling tasks, model interpretability is especially important to these studies towards understanding the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently gained popularity in various types of genomic and epigenomic studies due to their capabilities in utilizing large-scale high-throughput bioinformatics data and achieving high accuracy in predictions and classifications. However, DNNs are often challenged by their potential to explain the predictions due to their black-box nature. In this review, we present current development in the model interpretation of DNNs, focusing on their applications in genomics and epigenomics. We first describe state-of-the-art DNN interpretation methods in representative machine learning fields. We then summarize the DNN interpretation methods in recent studies on genomics and epigenomics, focusing on current data- and computing-intensive topics such as sequence motif identification, genetic variations, gene expression, chromatin interactions and non-coding RNAs. We also present the biological discoveries that resulted from these interpretation methods. We finally discuss the advantages and limitations of current interpretation approaches in the context of genomic and epigenomic studies. Contact:xiaoman@mail.ucf.edu, haihu@cs.ucf.edu},

  abstract = {Physical interactions between distinct chromosomal genomic loci are important for genomic functions including recombination and gene expression, but the mechanisms by which these interactions occur remain obscure. Using telomeric association as a model system, we analyzed here the in vivo organization of chromosome ends of haploid yeast cells during interphase. We separately labeled most of the 32 subtelomeres and analyzed their positions both in nuclear space and relative to three representative reference subtelomeres by high-throughput 3D microscopy and image processing. We show that subtelomeres are positioned nonrandomly at the nuclear periphery, depending on the genomic size of their chromosome arm, centromere attachment to the microtubule organizing center (spindle pole body, SPB), and the volume of the nucleolus. The distance of subtelomeres to the SPB increases consistently with chromosome arm length up to {$\approx$}300 kb; for larger arms the influence of chromosome arm length is weaker, but the effect of the nucleolar volume is stronger. Distances between pairs of subtelomeres also exhibit arm-length dependence and suggest, together with dynamic tracking experiments, that potential associations between subtelomeres are unexpectedly infrequent and transient. Our results suggest that interactions between subtelomeres are nonspecific and instead governed by physical constraints, including chromosome structure, attachment to the SPB, and nuclear crowding.},

  abstract = {Theory predicts that sexual reproduction is difficult to maintain if asexuality is an option, yet sex is very common. To understand why, it is important to pay attention to repeatably occurring conditions that favour transitions to, or persistence of, asexuality. Geographic parthenogenesis is a term that has been applied to describe a large variety of patterns where sexual and related asexual forms differ in their geographic distribution. Often asexuality is stated to occur in a habitat that is, in some sense, marginal, but the interpretation differs across studies: parthenogens might not only predominate near the margin of the sexuals' distribution, but might also extend far beyond the sexual range; they may be disproportionately found in newly colonizable areas (e.g. areas previously glaciated), or in habitats where abiotic selection pressures are relatively stronger than biotic ones (e.g. cold, dry). Here, we review the various patterns proposed in the literature, the hypotheses put forward to explain them, and the assumptions they rely on. Surprisingly, few mathematical models consider geographic parthenogenesis as their focal question, but all models for the evolution of sex could be evaluated in this framework if the (often ecological) causal factors vary predictably with geography. We also recommend broadening the taxa studied beyond the traditional favourites.             This article is part of the themed issue `Weird sex: the underappreciated diversity of sexual reproduction'.},

The focus of this study is twofold: First, we perform a frequency space analysis of the ``signal'' generated from ATAC-seq experiments' short reads, at a single-nucleotide resolution, using a discrete wavelet transform. Second, we explore different uses of neural networks to combine this signal with its underlying genome sequence in order to classify ATAC-seq peaks on the presence or absence of bidirectional transcription. We analyze the performance of different data encoding schemes and machine learning architectures, and show how a hybrid signal/sequence representation classified using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) yields the best performance across different cell types.},

High-throughput chromosome conformation capture experiments such as Hi-C are used to obtain genome-wide maps of three-dimensional chromatin contacts. However, robust estimation of data quality and systematic comparison of these contact maps is challenging due to the multi-scale, hierarchical structure of chromatin contacts and the resulting properties of experimental noise in the data. Measuring concordance of contact maps is important for assessing reproducibility of replicate experiments and for modeling variation between different cellular contexts.We introduce a concordance measure called DIfferences between Smoothed COntact maps (GenomeDISCO) for assessing the similarity of a pair of contact maps obtained from chromosome conformation capture experiments. The key idea is to smooth contact maps using random walks on the contact map graph, before estimating concordance. We use simulated datasets to benchmark GenomeDISCO's sensitivity to different types of noise that affect chromatin contact maps. When applied to a large collection of Hi-C datasets, GenomeDISCO accurately distinguishes biological replicates from samples obtained from different cell types. GenomeDISCO also generalizes to other chromosome conformation capture assays, such as HiChIP.Software implementing GenomeDISCO is available at https://github.com/kundajelab/genomedisco.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Salmonella               constitutes a genus of zoonotic bacteria of  worldwide economic and health importance. The  current view of salmonella taxonomy assigns the  members of this genus to two species:               S. enterica               and               S. bongori               .               S. enterica               itself is divided into six  subspecies,               enterica               ,               salamae               ,               arizonae               ,               diarizonae               ,               indica               , and               houtenae               , also known as subspecies I, II,  IIIa, IIIb, IV, and VI, respectively [1]. Members of               Salmonella enterica               subspecies               enterica               are mainly  associated with warm-blooded vertebrates and are  usually transmitted by ingestion of food or water  contaminated by infected faeces. The pathogenicity of  most of the distinct serotypes remains undefined, and  even within the most common serotypes, many  questions remain to be answered regarding the  interactions between the organism and the infected  host.                                         Salmonellosis manifests itself in three major forms:  enteritis, septicaemia, and abortion, each of which  may be present singly or in combination, depending  on both the serotype and the host involved. Although  currently over 2300 serovars of               Salmonella               are  recognized, only about 50 serotypes are isolated in  any significant numbers as human or animal  pathogens [2, 3] and they all belong to subspecies               enterica               . Of these, most cause acute gastroenteritis  characterized by a short incubation period and a  severe systemic disease in man or animals, characterized by septicaemia, fever and/or abortion, and  such serotypes are often associated with one or few  host species [4\textendash 6].                                         It is the intention of this review to present a  summary of current knowledge of these host-adapted  serotypes of               S. enterica               . The taxonomic relationships  between the serotypes will be discussed together with  a comparison of the pathology and pathogenesis of  the disease that they cause in their natural host(s).  Since much of our knowledge on salmonellosis is  based on the results of work on Typhimurium, this  serotype will often be used as the baseline in  discussion. It is hoped that an appreciation of the  differences that exist in the way these serotypes  interact with the host will lead to a greater understanding of the complex host\textendash parasite relationship  that characterizes salmonella infections.},

In Hymenoptera sex is usually determined by a single locus, heterozygotes are female and hemizygotes are male. Under inbreeding, homozygous diploid and sterile males occur which form a genetic burden for a population. We review life history and genetical traits that may overcome the disadvantages of single locus complementary sex determination (sl-CSD). Behavioural adaptations to avoid matings between relatives include active dispersal from natal patches and mating preferences for nonrelatives. In non-social species, temporal and spatial segregation of male and female offspring reduces the burden of sl-CSD. In social species, diploid males are produced at the expense of workers and female reproductives. In some social species, diploid males and diploid male producing queens are killed by workers. Diploid male production may have played a role in the evolution or maintenance of polygyny (multiple queens) and polyandry (multiple mating). Some forms of thelytoky (parthenogenetic female production) increase homozygosity and are therefore incompatible with sl-CSD. We discuss a number of hypothetical adaptations to sl-CSD which should be considered in future studies of this insect order.},

As only metallo-Fur acts as an autogeneous repressor, Fe2+scarcity would direct fur expression when continued supply is not obviously required. We show that in Escherichia coli post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms ensure that Fur synthesis remains steady in iron limitation. Our studies revealed that fur translation is coupled to that of an upstream open reading frame (uof), translation of which is downregulated by the non-coding RNA (ncRNA) RyhB. As RyhB transcription is negatively controlled by metallo-Fur, iron depletion creates a negative feedback loop. RyhB-mediated regulation of uof-fur provides the first example for indirect translational regulation by a trans-encoded ncRNA. In addition, we present evidence for an iron-responsive decoding mechanism of the uof-fur entity. It could serve as a backup mechanism of the RyhB circuitry, and represents the first link between iron availability and synthesis of an iron-containing protein.},

  abstract = {The onset and the termination of innate immune response must be tightly regulated to maintain homeostasis and prevent excessive inflammation, which can be detrimental to the organism, particularly in the context of sepsis. Endotoxin tolerance and compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS) describe a state of hypo-responsiveness characterized by reduced capacity of myeloid cells to respond to inflammatory stimuli, particularly those initiated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). To achieve endotoxin tolerance, extensive reprogramming otherwise termed as ``innate immune training'', is required that leads to both modifications of the intracellular components of TLR signaling and also to alterations in extracellular soluble mediators. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been recognized as critical regulators of TLR signaling. Specifically, several microRNAs (miR-146, miR-125b, miR-98, miR-579, miR-132, let-7e and others) are induced upon TLR activation and reciprocally promote endotoxin tolerance and/or cross tolerance. Many other miRNAs have been also shown to negatively regulate TLR signaling. The long non-coding (lnc)RNAs (Mirt2, THRIL, MALAT1, lincRNA-21 and others) are also altered upon TLR activation and negatively regulate TLR signaling. Furthermore, the promotion or termination of myeloid cell tolerance is not only regulated by intracellular mediators but is also affected by other TLR-independent soluble signals that often achieve their effect via modulation of intracellular ncRNAs. In this article, we review recent evidence on the role of different ncRNAs in the context of innate immune cell tolerance and trained immunity, and evaluate their impact on immune system homeostasis.},

Acanthamoeba spp. and B. mandrillaris are opportunistic pathogens causing infections of the central nervous system, lungs, sinuses and skin, mostly in immunocompromised humans. Balamuthia is also associated with disease in immunocompetent children, and Acanthamoeba spp. cause a sight-threatening infection, Acanthamoeba keratitis, mostly in contact-lens wearers. Of more than 30 species of Naegleria, only one species, N. fowleri, causes an acute and fulminating meningoencephalitis in immunocompetent children and young adults. In addition to human infections, Acanthamoeba, Balamuthia and Naegleria can cause central nervous system infections in animals. Because only one human case of encephalitis caused by Sappinia diploidea is known, generalizations about the organism as an agent of disease are premature. In this review we summarize what is known of these free-living amoebae, focusing on their biology, ecology, types of disease and diagnostic methods. We also discuss the clinical profiles, mechanisms of pathogenesis, pathophysiology, immunology, antimicrobial sensitivity and molecular characteristics of these amoebae.},

Individual genomic regions showed distinct configurations in relation to the chromosome 6 terrritory. Large chromatin loops containing several megabases of DNA were observed extending outwards from the surface of the domain defined by the specific chromosome 6 paint. The frequency with which a genomic region was observed on an external chromatin loop was cell type dependent and appeared to be related to the number of active genes in that region. Transcriptional up-regulation of genes in the major histocompatibility complex by interferon-gamma led to an increase in the frequency with which this large gene cluster was found on an external chromatin loop. Our data are consistent with an association between large-scale chromatin organization of specific genomic regions and their transcriptional status.},

Pilon works with many types of sequence data, but is particularly strong when supplied with paired end data from two Illumina libraries with small e.g., 180 bp and large e.g., 3\textendash 5 Kb inserts. Pilon significantly improves draft genome assemblies by correcting bases, fixing mis-assemblies and filling gaps. For both haploid and diploid genomes, Pilon produces more contiguous genomes with fewer errors, enabling identification of more biologically relevant genes. Furthermore, Pilon identifies small variants with high accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art tools and is unique in its ability to accurately identify large sequence variants including duplications and resolve large insertions. Pilon is being used to improve the assemblies of thousands of new genomes and to identify variants from thousands of clinically relevant bacterial strains. Pilon is freely available as open source software.},

Chicken meat and eggs are the main sources of human salmonellosis. DNA methylation is involved in regulatory processes including gene expression, chromatin structure and genomic imprinting. To understand the methylation regulation in the response to SE inoculation in chicken, the genome-wide DNA methylation profile following SE inoculation was analyzed through whole-genome bisulfite sequencing in the current study. There were 185,362,463 clean reads and 126,098,724 unique reads in the control group, and 180,530,750 clean reads and 126,782,896 unique reads in the inoculated group. The methylation density in the gene body was higher than that in the upstream and downstream regions of the gene. There were 8946 differentially methylated genes (3639 hypo-methylated genes, 5307 hyper-methylated genes) obtained between inoculated and control groups. Methylated genes were mainly enriched in immune-related Gene Ontology (GO) terms and metabolic process terms. Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, TGF-beta signaling pathway, FoxO signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway and several metabolism-related pathways were significantly enriched. The density of differentially methylated cytosines in miRNAs was the highest. HOX genes were widely methylated. The genome-wide DNA methylation profile in the response to SE inoculation in chicken was analyzed. SE inoculation promoted the DNA methylation in the chicken cecum and caused methylation alteration in immune- and metabolic- related genes. Wnt signal pathway, miRNAs and HOX gene family may play crucial roles in the methylation regulation of SE inoculation in chicken. The findings herein will deepen the understanding of epigenetic regulation in the response to SE inoculation in chicken.},

Natural IgM are reactive with many conserved epitopes, including those shared by microorganisms and autoantigens. As a result, these antibodies play important roles in clearing intruding pathogens, as well as apoptotic/necrotic cells and otherwise damaged tissues. While natural IgM binds to target structures with low affinity due to a lack of significant selection by somatic hypermutation, its pentameric structure with 10 antigen-binding sites enables these antibodies to bind multivalent target antigens with high avidity. Opsonization of antigen complexed with IgM is mediated by cell surface Fc receptors. While the existence of Fc alpha/mu receptor has been known for some time, only recently has the Fc receptor specific for IgM (FCMR) been identified. In this review, we focus on our current understandings of how natural IgM and FCMR regulate the immune system and maintain homeostasis under physiological and pathological conditions.},

However, the molecular mechanisms by which these histone marks function in chromosome compartmentalization are poorly understood. Constitutive heterochromatin is a largely silent chromosome compartment characterized in part by H3K9me2 and 3. Here, we show that heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), an H3K9me2 and 3 ``reader,'' interacts with SUV39H1, an H3K9me2 and 3 ``writer,'' and with TRIM28, an abundant HP1 scaffolding protein, to form complexes with increased multivalent engagement of H3K9me2 and 3-modified chromatin. H3K9me2 and 3-marked nucleosomal arrays and associated complexes undergo phase separation to form macromolecule-enriched liquid droplets. The droplets are reminiscent of heterochromatin as they are highly dense chromatin-containing structures that are resistant to DNase and exclude the general transcription factor TFIIB. Our data suggest a general mechanism by which histone marks regulate chromosome compartmentalization by promoting phase separation.},

  abstract = {Background: Given the demonstrated utility of Third Generation Sequencing [Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)] long reads in many studies, a comprehensive analysis and comparison of their data quality and applications is in high demand. Methods: Based on the transcriptome sequencing data from human embryonic stem cells, we analyzed multiple data features of PacBio and ONT, including error pattern, length, mappability and technical improvements over previous platforms. We also evaluated their application to transcriptome analyses, such as isoform identification and quantification and characterization of transcriptome complexity, by comparing the performance of size-selected PacBio, non-size-selected ONT and their corresponding Hybrid-Seq strategies (PacBio+Illumina and ONT+Illumina). Results: PacBio shows overall better data quality, while ONT provides a higher yield. As with data quality, PacBio performs marginally better than ONT in most aspects for both long reads only and Hybrid-Seq strategies in transcriptome analysis. In addition, Hybrid-Seq shows superior performance over long reads only in most transcriptome analyses. Conclusions: Both PacBio and ONT sequencing are suitable for full-length single-molecule transcriptome analysis. As this first use of ONT reads in a Hybrid-Seq analysis has shown, both PacBio and ONT can benefit from a combined Illumina strategy. The tools and analytical methods developed here provide a resource for future applications and evaluations of these rapidly-changing technologies.},

Diploids heterozygous at one or more CSD loci develop into females but diploids homozygous at all loci develop into diploid males, which are generally sterile or inviable. Species with multiple polymorphic CSD loci (ml-CSD) may have lower rates of diploid male production than species with a single CSD locus (sl-CSD), but it is not clear if polymorphism is consistently maintained at all loci. Here we assess the rate of diploid male production in a population of Cotesia rubecula, a two-locus CSD parasitoid wasp species, approximately 20 years after the population was introduced for biological control. We show that diploid male production dropped from 8-13\% in 2005 and 2006 to 3-4\% by 2015. We also show from experimental crosses that the population maintained polymorphism at both CSD loci in 2015. We use theory and simulations to show that balancing selection on all CSD alleles promotes polymorphism at several loci in ml-CSD populations. Our study supports the hypothesis that ml-CSD populations have lower diploid male production and are more likely to persist than comparable sl-CSD populations.},

  abstract = {Macrophages and neutrophils play a decisive role in host responses to intracellular bacteria including the agent of tuberculosis (TB), Mycobacterium tuberculosis as they represent the forefront of innate immune defense against bacterial invaders. At the same time, these phagocytes are also primary targets of intracellular bacteria to be abused as host cells. Their efficacy to contain and eliminate intracellular M. tuberculosis decides whether a patient initially becomes infected or not. However, when the infection becomes chronic or even latent (as in the case of TB) despite development of specific immune activation, phagocytes have also important effector functions. Macrophages have evolved a myriad of defense strategies to combat infection with intracellular bacteria such as M. tuberculosis. These include induction of toxic anti-microbial effectors such as nitric oxide and reactive oxygen intermediates, the stimulation of microbe intoxication mechanisms via acidification or metal accumulation in the phagolysosome, the restriction of the microbe's access to essential nutrients such as iron, fatty acids, or amino acids, the production of anti-microbial peptides and cytokines, along with induction of autophagy and efferocytosis to eliminate the pathogen. On the other hand, M. tuberculosis, as a prime example of a well-adapted facultative intracellular bacterium, has learned during evolution to counter-balance the host's immune defense strategies to secure survival or multiplication within this otherwise hostile environment. This review provides an overview of innate immune defense of macrophages directed against intracellular bacteria with a focus on M. tuberculosis. Gaining more insights and knowledge into this complex network of host-pathogen interaction will identify novel target sites of intervention to successfully clear infection at a time of rapidly emerging multi-resistance of M. tuberculosis against conventional antibiotics.},

We report the optimization of circular consensus sequencing (CCS) to improve the accuracy of single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing (PacBio) and generate highly accurate (99.8\%) long high-fidelity (HiFi) reads with an average length of 13.5\,kilobases (kb). We applied our approach to sequence the well-characterized human HG002/NA24385 genome and obtained precision and recall rates of at least 99.91\% for single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), 95.98\% for insertions and deletions {$<$}50 bp (indels) and 95.99\% for structural variants. Our CCS method matches or exceeds the ability of short-read sequencing to detect small variants and structural variants. We estimate that 2,434 discordances are correctable mistakes in the `genome in a bottle' (GIAB) benchmark set. Nearly all (99.64\%) variants can be phased into haplotypes, further improving variant detection. De novo genome assembly using CCS reads alone produced a contiguous and accurate genome with a contig N50 of {$>$}15\,megabases (Mb) and concordance of 99.997\%, substantially outperforming assembly with less-accurate long reads.},

SLC1A5 (hATB0,+), a neutral amino acid transporter, was upregulated in the host cells after infection with L. pneumophila. Inhibition of SLC1A5 by BCH, a competitive inhibitor of amino acid uptake as well as siRNA silencing of the slc1a5 gene blocked intracellular multiplication of L. pneumophila without compromising viability of host cells. These observations suggest that replication of L. pneumophila depends on the function of host cell SLC1A5.},

Typhimurium) causes acute gut inflammation by using its virulence factors to invade the intestinal epithelium and survive in mucosal macrophages. The inflammatory response enhances the transmission success of S. Typhimurium by promoting its outgrowth in the gut lumen through unknown mechanisms. Here we show that reactive oxygen species generated during inflammation react with endogenous, luminal sulphur compounds (thiosulphate) to form a new respiratory electron acceptor, tetrathionate. The genes conferring the ability to use tetrathionate as an electron acceptor produce a growth advantage for S. Typhimurium over the competing microbiota in the lumen of the inflamed gut. We conclude that S. Typhimurium virulence factors induce host-driven production of a new electron acceptor that allows the pathogen to use respiration to compete with fermenting gut microbes. Thus the ability to trigger intestinal inflammation is crucial for the biology of this diarrhoeal pathogen.},

  abstract = {Background: Legionella pneumophila is a gram-negative bacterial pathogen that is the cause of Legionnaires' Disease. Legionella produces disease because it can replicate inside a specialized compartment of host macrophages. Macrophages isolated from various inbred mice exhibit large differences in permissiveness for intracellular replication of Legionella. A locus affecting this host-resistance phenotype, Lgn1, has been mapped to chromosome 13, but the responsible gene has not been identified. Results: Here, we report that Naip5 (also known as Birc1e) influences susceptibility to Legionella. Naip5 encodes a protein that is homologous to plant innate immunity (so-called ``resistance'') proteins and has been implicated in signaling pathways related to apoptosis regulation. Detailed recombination mapping and analysis of expression implicates Naip5 in the Legionella permissiveness differences among mouse strains. A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic line expressing a nonpermissive allele of Naip5 exhibits a reduction in macrophage Legionella permissiveness. In addition, morpholino-based antisense inhibition of Naip5 causes an increase in the Legionella permissiveness of macrophages. Conclusions: We conclude that polymorphisms in Naip5 are involved in the permissiveness differences of mouse macrophages for intracellular Legionella replication. We speculate that Naip5 is a functional mammalian homolog of plant ``resistance'' proteins that monitor for, and initiate host response to, the presence of secreted bacterial virulence proteins.},

Here we resolve the spatial organization of the circular chromosome of bacteria by directly imaging the chromosome in live             E. coli             cells with a broadened cell shape. The chromosome was observed to exhibit a torus topology with a 4.2 {$\mu$}m toroidal length and 0.4 {$\mu$}m bundle thickness. On average, the DNA density along the chromosome shows dense right and left arms that branch from a lower-density origin of replication, and are connected at the terminus of replication by an ultrathin flexible string of DNA. At the single-cell level, the DNA density along the torus is found to be strikingly heterogeneous, with blob-like Mbp-size domains that undergo major dynamic rearrangements, splitting and merging at a minute timescale. We show that prominent domain boundaries at the terminus and origin of replication are induced by MatP proteins, while weaker transient domain boundaries are facilitated by the global transcription regulators HU and Fis. These findings provide an architectural basis for the understanding of the spatial organization of bacterial genomes.},

The evolutionary processes that allow herbivorous insects to resist plant defenses remain largely unknown. The whitefly Bemisia tabaci is a cosmopolitan, highly polyphagous agricultural pest that vectors several serious plant pathogenic viruses and is an excellent model to probe the molecular mechanisms involved in overcoming plant defenses. Here, we show that, through an exceptional horizontal gene transfer event, the whitefly has acquired the plant-derived phenolic glucoside malonyltransferase gene BtPMaT1. This gene enables whiteflies to neutralize phenolic glucosides. This was confirmed by genetically transforming tomato plants to produce small interfering RNAs that silence BtPMaT1, thus impairing the whiteflies' detoxification ability. These findings reveal an evolutionary scenario whereby herbivores harness the genetic toolkit of their host plants to develop resistance to plant defenses and how this can be exploited for crop protection.},

  abstract = {Information about developmental gene expression resides in defined regulatory elements, called enhancers, in the non-coding part of the genome. Although cells reliably utilize enhancers to orchestrate gene expression, a cis-regulatory code that would allow their interpretation has remained one of the greatest challenges of modern biology. In this review, we summarize studies from the past three decades that describe progress towards revealing the properties of enhancers and discuss how recent approaches are providing unprecedented insights into regulatory elements in animal genomes. Over the next years, we believe that the functional characterization of regulatory sequences in entire genomes, combined with recent computational methods, will provide a comprehensive view of genomic regulatory elements and their building blocks and will enable researchers to begin to understand the sequence basis of the cis-regulatory code.},

  abstract = {Hi-C is a powerful technology for studying genome-wide chromatin interactions. However, current methods for assessing Hi-C data reproducibility can produce misleading results because they ignore spatial features in Hi-C data, such as domain structure and distance dependence. We present HiCRep, a framework for assessing the reproducibility of Hi-C data that systematically accounts for these features. In particular, we introduce a novel similarity measure, the stratum adjusted correlation coefficient (SCC), for quantifying the similarity between Hi-C interaction matrices. Not only does it provide a statistically sound and reliable evaluation of reproducibility, SCC can also be used to quantify differences between Hi-C contact matrices and to determine the optimal sequencing depth for a desired resolution. The measure consistently shows higher accuracy than existing approaches in distinguishing subtle differences in reproducibility and depicting interrelationships of cell lineages. The proposed measure is straightforward to interpret and easy to compute, making it well-suited for providing standardized, interpretable, automatable, and scalable quality control. The freely available R package HiCRep implements our approach.},

Repeated sequence elements averaging 140 bp were identified and found to bind a protein required for optimum Initiation at the core promoter. These repeated elements were shown to stimulate rRNA transcription by RNA polymerase I in vitro. The repeats inhibited transcription when placed In trans, and stimulated transcription when in cis, In either orientation, but only when upstream of the core promoter. Thus, these repeated elements have characteristics similar to polymenre I enhancers found in higher eukaryotes. The number of rRNA repeats In Acanthamoeba cells was determined to be 24 per haploid genome, the lowest number so far identified in any eukaryote. However, because Acanthamoeba is polyploid, each cell contains approximately 600 rRNA genes.},

In so doing, they present data structures that are different from conventional 1D signal tracks. To exploit the 2D nature of Hi-C contact maps, matrix techniques like spectral analysis are particularly useful. Here, we present HiC-spector, a collection of matrix-related functions for analyzing Hi-C contact maps. In particular, we introduce a novel reproducibility metric for quantifying the similarity between contact maps based on spectral decomposition. The metric successfully separates contact maps mapped from Hi-C data coming from biological replicates, pseudo-replicates and different cell types.Source code in Julia and Python, and detailed documentation is available at https://github.com/gersteinlab/HiC-spector.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in controlling various aspects of embryonic stem cell (ESC) biology, although the functions of specific lncRNAs, and the molecular mechanisms through which they act, remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate discrete and opposing roles for the lncRNA transcript Haunt and its genomic locus in regulating the HOXA gene cluster during ESC differentiation. Reducing or enhancing Haunt expression, with minimal disruption of the Haunt locus, led to upregulation or downregulation of HOXA genes, respectively. In contrast, increasingly large genomic deletions within the Haunt locus attenuated HOXA activation. The Haunt DNA locus contains potential enhancers of HOXA activation, whereas Haunt RNA acts to prevent aberrant HOXA expression. This work reveals a multifaceted model of lncRNA-mediated transcriptional regulation of the HOXA cluster, with distinct roles for a lncRNA transcript and its genomic locus, while illustrating the power of rapid CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing for assigning lncRNA functions.},
